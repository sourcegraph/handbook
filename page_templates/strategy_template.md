# Strategy page template

> ℹ️  The following is a template for use on the pages of specific product & engineering teams, used to record and share your strategy and ultimately organize and communicate your thinking around prioritization. Some sections may be more applicable to customer-facing product teams, such as the analyst and competitive landscape sections, so feel free to customize or remove any that you know are not relevant to your strategy.

> As you write this document, keep in mind that focusing on problems to solve more than lists of features tends to be a better way to approach communicating with people interested in your product team/area (customers, sales, analysts, etc.) as it leaves room for learning between what you know now and what you deliver in the end. This is not to say you never talk about features, but especially as you get [further out in planning](https://medium.com/@jobv/the-nearsighted-roadmap-57fa57b5906a) the blend of features vs. problems to solve should move more towards the latter.

> Be sure also to explain [why something is part of your strategy](https://medium.com/leadership-motivation-and-impact/the-power-of-starting-with-why-f8e491392ef8). What you are doing is interesting, but why you have chosen that of all the possibilities is often even more enlightening.

# ProductTeam Strategy

## Mission

> What is the team's reason for existing and what do you want to achieve over three, even ten years? What is the fundamental value you aim to provide? Who are your key customers/stakeholders and why, and are there any customers/stakeholders that you're explicitly choosing not to address that people might have expected you to? You can also introduce briefly where you're headed in the next year, but there's a more in-depth section below for that.

## Guiding principles

> Identify what key principles, insights, and decisions are important to the strategy or a set of key hypotheses and set of key questions to validate or invalidate them.
>
> Describe the targets by which we prioritize:
>
> - Market or audience
> - [Personas](../../marketing/personas.md)
> - Jobs or Use Cases
> - Industries
> - What matters to us when we prioritize products and features
> - Contextual things that matter to Sourcegraph or the product

## Where we are now

> - Where is the team's area of ownership in terms of its maturity? Is it new and basic, or complete and lovable? Are different features at different levels?
> - What did we achieve in the last few months?
> - What key learnings did we recently make?
> - What is on the critical path for growth?
> - How does the product fit within Sourcegraph as a whole?

### Top customer, support, sales and marketing issues

> - What are the top issues customers are facing? (All, you can call out ones we're tackling (or not) in the Strategy & Plans section)
> - What are the top requests from other teams at Sourcegraph? (All, you can call out ones we're tackling (or not) in the Strategy & Plans section)

### Competitive landscape

> - Who is the competition for this product team?
> - What recent developments in competition is impacting sales, marketing and product strategy?

## Strategy and Plans

> Be sure to make the timeframe you choose to use clear, whether a quarter or rolling 12 months

### Goals

> What are the measurable goals this team is going after in the chosen time period.

### Themes

> What are high level themes, and why? What are the groupings of features/problems to solve that you are focusing on in that period? How do they relate to the goals you have
> 
> Examples:
>
> - A product differentiator
> - Cloud-first
> - Adoption
> 
> - Theme
>   - Theme extra detail
> - Theme
>   - Theme extra detail
> - Theme
>   - Theme extra detail

### What's next and why

> More detailed plans related back to the themes and goals. If your time frame covers more than a quarter, it would be valuable to give some indication of time within the plans in this section, to help others appreciate the likely ETA of value.

### What we're not working on & why

> What are we explicitly not working on? Are there frequent requests from customers or other teams we are choosing not to take on? Making that explicit makes other teams understand the strategy and reduces back and forth.
> 
> If there is a time component (e.g. "We're not working on this this Q but likely to pick it up next Q"), call it out.
