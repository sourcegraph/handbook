# Field Go-to-Market and Operations Team Charter

## Field GTM and Ops Purpose

The Field GTM and Operations team prioritizes delivering real value to our customers (both internally and externally). We aim for quick, straightforward solutions, built on teamwork. Every decision we make focuses on enhancing the customer's experience and supporting growth.

## Structure

The Field GTM and Operations Team has 2 distinct functions made up of 6 teams:
GTM Operations & Execution (GTM Ops + Systems)
GTM Support (Enablement, Partnerships, SDRs, and VCBOD)

## Operating Principles

The Field GTM and Ops operating principles should guide our every decision:

<p align="center"> <em>We believe in delivering real value through thoughtful effort. While we move quickly, and prioritize simplicity, we always get feedback from our field teams as it is invaluable.</em> </p>

- #### **Value-driven impact:**

  “Quality is never an accident. It is always the result of intelligent effort.”

  - Focus on delivering genuine value. Prioritize initiatives and tasks that don't just tick boxes but directly align with customer success and company growth.

- #### **Velocity through simplicity:**

  “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”

  - Prioritize clear and concise MVPs. Speed matters, but not at the expense of clarity. Simple, actionable solutions accelerate our GTM strategies.

- #### **Field feedback first:**

  “We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.”

  - Ground insights in field experiences. Direct feedback shapes practical, timely strategies.

- #### **Collaborate, don't isolate:**

  “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.”

  - Break departmental silos. Open dialogues drive cross-functional insights and unified messaging.

- #### **Enable, don’t just deliver:**
  “Give a Man a Fish, and You Feed Him for a Day. Teach a Man To Fish, and You Feed Him for a Lifetime”
  - Equip the field with tools and knowledge. Effective enablement 10Xs the field’s productivity.

## Q3 / Q4 initiatives, deliverables, and goals

This should be a comprehensive list of the major things you expect to work in in H2 this year. They can be short-term, long-term, quantitative or qualitative. We are writing our initiatives, deliverables, and goals down here so we can see where we can support each other and hold each other accountable to delivering on the things we think are critical to the success of the business.

<p align="center"> <em>NOTE: this is not a comprehensive list, I quickly wrote down what I know (or think I know) to be in-flight right now. It is far from complete / accurate, so please update! </em> </p>
