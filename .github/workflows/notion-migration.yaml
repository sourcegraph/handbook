To ensure it is the case, it's now mandatory to get an approving review to merge a pull request.\n\nExamples\n\n- Setting up a redirection to a Notion page: PR will be approved.\n- Correcting an important mistake on a page that doesn't have an equivalent yet: PR will be approved.\n- Updating content that isn't mission critical: PR will be rejected.\n\nSourcegraphers: Reach out to [#wg-notion](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C06T68DBMSA) if you have any question."
