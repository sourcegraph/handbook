            Hey there! It looks like this pull request has been sitting for a long time. Keep in mind that when you make a pull request, the change doesn't actually go live until you **merge** the pull request. This needs to be done by you (the pull request author) as soon as you feel like you got the appropriate amount of review/approvals that make you confident with the change. For example: adding yourself to the team page doesn't require anyone's review and you can merge directly, while when proposing a change to your team's processes you'll probably want to get your team's review (and need to request review from your team explicitly, so they get notified).

            Please see whether you want to **merge** this pull request, **close** it and discard the change, or **remind** the people you would like review from.

            You can find more help on our [Editing the handbook](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/editing) handbook page.

            Thank you! \\(^-^)/
