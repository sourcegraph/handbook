# Handbook Usage & Principles

## What is the Handbook?

### Guiding Principles

- **The Handbook can ve viewed by anyone.** One of our Sourcegraph values is transparency. We want all public information to be available to everyone, whether they work at Sourcegraph or not, and it all lives in the Handbook. The Handbook should be searchable and easy to navigate.
- **The Handbook can be edited by any Sourcegraph teammate.** We value high agency and encourage all teammates to update the Handbook as they see fit. We provide resources to help teammates contribute to the Handbook no matter their technical background.
- **The Handbook is maintained by every Sourcegraph teammate.** At Sourcegraph, we work as a team. No one person is responsible for keeping our content updated, it falls on all of us. Editing and updating pages should be quick and well documented.
- **The Handbook is a source of truth** at Sourcegraph, and information there is expected to be accurate and up-to-date.

### Intended Audience

Sourcegraph is an [open company](../company.md#open-company) and we value [transparency](../company/values.md#open-andtransparent). As such, we keep the Handbook public.

The **primary** intended audience for the Handbook is Sourcegraph teammates.

The **secondary** intended audience for the Handbook is Sourcegraph candidates.

Content intended for users of the Sourcegraph product should be part of [Sourcegraph Docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/).

## What does it mean to be Handbook-first?

## Why do we use Git? Why not a wiki or Google Docs?

The handbook consists of Markdown files in the Git repository at github.com/sourcegraph/handbook. Being [handbook-first](#why-handbook-first) means the Handbook must be kept up to date. There are several benefits in using Git over another format:

1. Many handbook changes require updating references and mentions across multiple pages. In wikis and Google Docs, there is no easy way to propose a _group_ of changes to multiple sections or pages, which means people making and reviewing edits can easily miss other places that need to be updated. This format allows grouped multi-page changes and collaboration. This is more complicated than wikis or Google Docs, but we commit to help every teammate [learn how to edit this handbook](editing/index.md).
1. Many handbook changes are collaborative and need to be reviewed, revised, and commented on by other teammates. Git makes this possible, with comments and code reviews. Wikis don't make this easy or possible, and Google Docs has very limited review and no revision capabilities.

## Handbook feedback

We're constantly working to make the Handbook better. Is it easy to use? Do you find what you're looking for? Let us know [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfb0yU9xmnvK2namuUzUEKbB9IqZlNQF2IWw0OpLsGvBiW2oQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
