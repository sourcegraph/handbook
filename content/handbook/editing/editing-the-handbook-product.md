# Contributing to the Handbook Product or Website

There are many facets to the Handbook. Some benefit greatly from distributed ownership, while others can benefit from unified vision and principles. As Sourcegraph continues to grow, and if we want to remain handbook-first, we want to make decisions for the Handbook that allow us to scale.

The purpose of this page is to define these facets, their ownership, and how to contribute to each. Ownership in this context means the person or group primarily responsible for driving improvements, owners are not the only contributors. The contribution sections below describe how (and by whom) these types of changes are made. These will change as the Handbook team grows, and the product evolves.

The Handbook is part of the [Content Platform team strategy](../../strategy-goals/strategy/enablement/content-platform/index.md).

## Handbook Facets
