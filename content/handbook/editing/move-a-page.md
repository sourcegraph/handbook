# Moving a Page

### GitHub Web Interface

All of the following needs to occur within one pull request. See [this page](multiple-changes-single-pr.md) for help on making multiple edits at once.

1. Rename the file to indicate its new location as described in [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location)
1. Wait for Handbook checks to run. When you move a page, any existing links to that page will break. You'll probably see a failure like this:
   ![Broken link handbook check failure](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/broken-link-failure.png)
1. Check out the "Broken Links" section on the [Handbook Checks page](handbook-check-failures.md#broken-link) for guidance on how to resolve these. They can be a bit tedious and hard to track down, so remember you can always ask the #handbook Slack channel for help.
