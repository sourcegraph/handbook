# Hiding the sidebar

Some pages have extra wide content and benefit from hiding the sidebar. You can enable this on a page by updating the frontmatter to include `hide_sidebar: true` as follows:

```
---
hide_sidebar: true
---
```

This will cause the page to not have a table of contents or contributor list. The edit page and history as diffs link will be at the bottom of the page instead.
