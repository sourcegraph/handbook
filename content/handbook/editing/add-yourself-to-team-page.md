### Steps:

1. Accept GitHub's email invite to the Sourcegraph org (you should be a member of [the `Everyone` group](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/everyone) in Sourcegraph's GitHub organization).
1. Are you in the Product organization? Then check the [additional steps for Product](#additional-steps-for-product) below.
1. Add yourself to the end of the [team.yml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/blob/main/data/team.yml) file by pasting the sample below and modifying it. You could consider including sites your LinkedIn, Twitter, or anything else in the links section. For pronunciation, you can record an audio file from your phone using [name-coach.com](https://www.name-coach.com/)). Feel free to include info on hobbies, work experience, family, pets, etc. in the description.
1. In the edit view, copy the example below, paste it at the end of the edit view, and make it about yourself! Look at others' bios for more examples.
1. Under "Commit changes" at the bottom of the page, replace the "Update team.yml" text with a summary of your change, e.g., Add Marie to team page.
1. Click the green "Commit changes" button. If you do not see the green "Commit Changes" button, refer to step 1. Successful changes will become visible shortly (but not immediately).
1. Consider adding yourself to the [team members locations map](../../team/locations.md).

You can find an example template below that uses all available features.

All fields except name are optional, and you can use markdown and emojis inside all the fields except `name`, `github`, and `email`; any fields using markdown should be quoted (i.e., surrounded with single or double quotes), just like the `links` example below.

The order of fields doesn't matter. If you aren't comfortable with markdown, you can check out our [tips and tricks page](markdown-resources.md). If you receive errors during the build, check the [handbook check failures page](handbook-check-failures.md).

Indentation is also important with YAML, there should be two spaces before every line with a field. Quoting is also important, if you use a single quote inside your description you should use a double quote outside (i.e., `description: "this is Marie's bio"`, or a single quote outside if you want to use double quotes inside (i.e., `description: 'This is the "best" bio'`). If you get stuck on YAML parsing errors check in the #handbook channel and lots of people can help.

```yaml
marie_curie:
  name: Marie Curie
  email: marie_curie@sourcegraph.com
  github: marie_curie
  pronouns: she/her
  role: Staff Scientist
  location: Passy, Haute-Savoie, France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
  links: '[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie)'
  pronunciation: https://forvo.com/word/marie_curie/
  description: I am a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. I was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and the only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. My husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner on her first Nobel Prize, making us the first ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. I was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.

## Additional steps for Product

The product team is testing out a new feature to automatically generate our org chart. For now no other teams need to do anything different, but this eventually may roll out company-wide.

If you have any trouble you can ask for help in #product-internal. If you are a manager and want an new interim manager role in your org chart, customize the same template below, but replace the root name, reporting line, and role description with whatever is appropriate.

### New managers

If you are joining as a new manager, there may be an interim role in the team.yml that you should customize, instead of creating a new one. It would look something like this (depending on your role), but if you're unsure then ask your manager:

```yaml
director_design:
  name: Christina Forney
  role: (Interim) Director of Design
  reports_to: vp_product
  manager_role_slug: director_design
  hidden_on_team_page: true
```

Instead of creating a new entry, you should update this one. Change the top level name of the object to your own name separated by underscores, replace the value of the name field with your own name, remove `(Interim)` from the title, and finally remove entirely the `hidden_on_team_page` field. You don't need to change the `manager_role_slug` value.

### New employees

If you are not a new manager, then proceed as normal. The only different thing you need to do is add a `reports_to:` field that matches the `manager_role_slug` for your manager. For example, if you report to Jason Yavorska, his `manager_role_slug` is `product_director_code_graph`. So you'd add a row that looks like this:

```yaml
your_name:
  name: Your Name
  reports_to: product_director_code_graph
```
