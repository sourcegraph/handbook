# Editing the handbook

Every Sourcegraph teammate will be editing the Sourcegraph handbook frequently to keep information up-to-date and participate in important changes in the company. This guide helps everyone learn how to edit the handbook.

The handbook consists of Markdown files in the Git repository at [github.com/sourcegraph/handbook](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/tree/main/content). ([Why not a wiki or Google Docs?](../index.md#why-do-we-use-git-why-not-a-wiki-or-google-docs))

## How to get help

We don't expect everyone on the team to figure this out on their own. Other teammates are happy to help!

- Any engineer at Sourcegraph can help. (The _code_ that engineers write at Sourcegraph also consists of files in a Git repository, so engineers are very familiar with making these kinds of edits.)
- [Teammates who have already made a handbook change](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/-/stats/contributors) can help.
- **Handbook support**: Ask the @handbook-support group in Slack (formerly called "handbook heroes") for handbook help (via DM, #handbook, or #any-question). They volunteered to help anyone with anything handbook-related! _If you too want to be part of handbook support, simply join the @handbook-support group in Slack_
- Ask in #handbook: "Who can screen-share with me to help me make an edit to the handbook?"
- Don't be afraid of breaking anything! It is very easy for any engineer on the team to roll back to the previous version of the handbook if you make a mistake.
