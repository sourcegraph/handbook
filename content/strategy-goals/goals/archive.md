## FY2021

Timeline: 2020-02-01 to 2021-01-31

- During the period of 2021-08 through 2022-01 we experimented with less structured goals, requesting that each team maintains a goals handbook page. The intention was to encourage more willingness to change and keep goals up to date, but the experiment did not achieve the desired outcome. We started back with an OKR process for FY2022.

- [FY21-Q1](2021_q1.md)

> Note: the switch from calendar year (CY) to fiscal year (FY) happened in December 2019. This means that 2020 is intentionally omitted as a section, because we started tracking towards the new fiscal year ending 2021-01-31, and there is actual continuity from CY19-Q4 with our next planned quarter designated FY21-Q1.
