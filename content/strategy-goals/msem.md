# MSEM Overview
We created a MSEM (mission, strategy, execution, metrics) doc to align on our plans for the year ahead and make sure we have a single source of truth that we can refer back to again and again. We plan to incorporate your feedback and share a final version with the whole company at Merge.
# Overview of the MSEM Framework
## Mission, Strategy, Execution, and Metrics (MSEM)
The Mission, Strategy, Execution, and Metrics (VSEM) framework is a tool for organizing and aligning Sourcegaph’s mission, strategy, and execution with the work we do on a daily basis. Tools have to be used and they have to be used appropriately (you don’t use a hammer to perform brain surgery) in order to be effective. 
## Breakdown of each section
Let’s break down each section of the VSEM framework to better understand how it works


- Mission 
Our very long-term (10+-year) ambition and purpose. The substance of the mission will not change, but the specific way we describe it will be reviewed annually to ensure it is compelling, relevant, and motivating.

- Strategy 
The strategy is Sourcegraph’s medium-term (1-2 year) plan for how to achieve our mission. It highlights the key strategic focus areas the company must execute against in order to make our mission a reality. The strategy will be revisited annually and likely evolve over time. 

- Execution
The execution plan is the process for how we will implement Sourcegraph’s strategy and highlight the necessary actions needed to achieve our mission. Each execution plan typically comprises a number of important projects and initiatives, critical decisions that need to be made, the allocation of resources, etc.


- Metrics 
These are the measures or indicators that Sourcegraph will use to track our progress towards our goals. They should be closely tied to the mission and strategy and will be used to gauge the effectiveness of the execution plan to make our strategy successful.

## How will Sourcegraph use the MSEM?

### Align and bring clarity to our mission and strategy
We haven’t directly connected our Mission  > Strategy together in a cohesive way. By aligning our strategy (medium-term) to our mission (purpose) we can bring much greater clarity and focus to our execution plan (short-term) to achieve our goals. 

### Focus and prioritize work on the things that matter
We all have to make 100+ decisions a day on what to do and where to spend our time / money / resources. The VSEM should help create clarity on how, where, and why you should choose to spend your time. With better prioritization and focus, come better decisions and all around execution. 

### Bring transparency and accountability to our progress 
Sourcegraph has not been good about focusing, measuring, tracking, and sharing performance at a company level. A simple, easily referenced and concrete artifact will help create a single point of reference to hold everyone accountable to their performance. This VSEM will be documented in the handbook, referenced in every issue of the Git Down, and progress will be tracked at company meetings.

### Create a culture shift
We need to use this framework Every. Single. Day. Tools are great, but they are only as effective as they are used and used effectively. If we aren’t looking at, talking about, or using the VSEM every day, we aren’t doing our job (this includes telling the exec team we aren’t using it enough!). Culture shifts are hard and they are all about  creating new habits and expectations.
