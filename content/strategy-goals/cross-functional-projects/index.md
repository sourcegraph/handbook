# Cross-functional projects

Cross-functional projects are designed to replace OKRs and narrow our focus down to the most actionable and impactful things we can do to bring more value to our customers and achieve our company goals and strategy.
These projects are organized around working groups that are monitored and tracked at the executive level and are expected to be completed within 1 - 2 quarters of their formation.

# Why are we moving away from OKRs?

When it comes down to it, OKRs are a tool, and not all tools work for every job. At Sourcegraph, OKRs have not been an effective tool for driving alignment and focus as we have consistently:

- Received feedback across the organization that creating OKRs has become a tedious process that doesn’t focus on what’s actually important
- Lagged behind setting quarterly objectives
- Failed to create meaningful and measurable KRs that can be achieved within the quarter
- Failed to drive meaningful progress or tangible outcomes towards achieving company goals and strategy since the adoption of OKRs

By shifting to more project-based work, we hope to see more tangible, meaningful and impactful outcomes for our company goals and strategy.

## How are cross-functional projects different from OKRs?

1. Cross-functional projects are project-based and focused on tangible outcomes

   - No more “meta” objectives that lead to a lack of accountability, ill-defined outcomes, and spurious measures of success.

2. Cross-functional projects are not bound by arbitrary quarterly cycles

   - Cross-functional projects should target short-to-medium term deliverables (roughly 1 - 2 quarters) and can be spun up / elevated or deprioritized as needed.
   - This will shift our focus from asking “what can we do within this quarter” to “what should we do to drive the most impact in as short a time as possible?”

3. Cross-functional projects are focused on dynamic cross-functional teamwork
   - We will no longer waste time trying to carve our specific roles for each department and align them to Objectives and Key Results.
   - Sometimes departments aren’t involved in really important projects and that’s OK.
   - Instead, we will leverage working groups and entrust those teams to include the appropriate teams and make the best decisions for the overall success of each project.

## Expectations, Roles, and Responsibilities

Each cross-functional project has a DRI and Executive Sponsor who are ultimately accountable for the success or failure of the project.

These projects are designed to be shut down and therefor must be self-sustaining after completion.

### Expectations

Each project must have a clear:

- Problem that needs to be solved that betters the experience of our customers, company, or sourcegraph teammates
- Measureable, trackable and self-sustaining solution
- Set of 'exit criteria' that clearly indicate when the project has reached its conclusion

### Directly Responsible Individuals (DRIs)

DRIs are responsible for:

- Creating and maintaining a high-functioning, cross-functional working group
- Setting the vision, strategy, and goals of the project
- Leading planning and managing dependencies for the project
- Creating scalable, repeatable processes for tracking and managing data
- Ensuring a cross-functional project handbook page is maintained and up-to-date
- Reporting to executive leadership on a weekly basis

### Executive Sponsors

The exec sponsors are responsible for:

- Supporting the DRI in securing and aligning internal resources and removing bottlenecks
- Supporting escalations as needed
- Attend all company goal working group meetings
- Act as an exec team liaison to ensure appropriate insight and alignment to other projects, initiatives, or programs
- Shares responsibility with the DRI for project success / failure

# Reporting Cadence and Updates

Philosophically, we will try for a 90/10 percent split between asynchronous and synchronous updates and communication.

- A summary of the week's work / color commentary on the project as a whole.
  - Update on the status of the project (Red / Yellow / Green).
  - What went well this week?
  - Action plan for next week?

#### Where:

- Handbook page
  - Make updates to this page as necessary / needed.
- #cross-functional-projects slack channel
  - Links to supporting documentation and with high-level summary submitted

## Synchronous Updates:

### Twice-weekly standups

#### When:

Every Monday and Friday. Time is based on team availability.

#### Who:

Exec Sponsor / DRI / Appropriate cross-functional project teammate

#### What:

A highly tactical conversation based on the supplied weekly report. Topics include

- How to overcome bottlenecks / blockers
  - Highlighting key milestones
  - Running through specific tasks expected to be completed this week and next.
- Where: Zoom meeting scheduled by EBP to CEO
