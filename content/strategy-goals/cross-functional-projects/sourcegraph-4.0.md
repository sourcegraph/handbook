# Sourcegraph 4.0 FAQ

### Sourcegraph 4.0

**What is Sourcegraph 4.0?**
Sourcegraph 4.0 is an upcoming major release of Sourcegraph. Product inclusions for 4.0 can be found in the [Release Post draft on GitHub](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/pull/5623).

**When is Sourcegraph 4.0?**
Sourcegraph 4.0 will be released on September 27, 2022, at the Starship launch event.

Engineering work on Sourcegraph 4.0 will end September 9, 2022.

**How is marketing supporting the 4.0 launch?**
Marketing will be running several promotional activities to support the launch:

- Publishing the [4.0 Release Post](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/pull/5623).
- Publishing several accompanying blog posts about our journey to 4.0.
- Creating a highlight reel video of updates included in 4.0.
- Hosting a livestream event on September 27.
- Promoting across social media channels.
- More activities to be defined.

**Why 4.0 and not 3.44?**
Sourcegraph 3.0 first released in February 2019. Since then, we have launched a number of significant products &amp; features. To name just a few:

- Code Insights
- Batch Changes
- Notebooks
- Precise code navigation via LSIF & SCIP

Today's Sourcegraph platform is far more advanced than the original Sourcegraph 3.0 product offering. Combined with the upcoming release in September, we believe it is time to release a new major version of Sourcegraph.

**What is the theme of Sourcegraph 4.0?**
The theme for 4.0 and the 4.0 launch event is the evolution of code search to becoming a code intelligence platform.

### Starship

**What is Sourcegraph Starship?**
Starship is a launch event that is planned for September 27, 2022. It includes 2 major projects:

1. Sourcegraph 4.0
2. Completion of the "Make Cloud the preferred deployment method" [cross-functional project](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/strategy-goals/cross-functional-projects/)

**Where did the "Starship" branding come from?**
"Star" refers to wildcard, Sourcegraph's logo.

"Ship" refers to shipping code, which will happen at this (and future) Starship events.

Therefore, Starship is an event for shipping new Sourcegraph features.

**Why are we using Starship branding?**
We wanted to introduce new event-based branding for this launch moment. This sets the stage for more future events, which we aspire to create.

In the future, we believe Starship will become a regular, recurring launch event, with the potential to become a full user conference.

### Making Cloud the preferred deployment method

**What does "Make Cloud the preferred deployment method" mean?**
This is a cross-functional project focused on Cloud (our single-tenant, managed version of Sourcegraph). You can find more details about this project in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IUFb2JkwqdLCf8B-FkiF40PyAFg50xfWnB6gQO2ViRQ/edit#heading=h.2md1aeolxqwl).

We intend to complete this project by September 27, in line with the Starship event.
