# Dev Experience team strategy

This page outlines the vision, strategy, and goals of the [Dev Experience team](../../../../departments/product-engineering/engineering/enablement/dev-experience/index.md).

## Mission

Make it so that every developer feels empowered to be productive in contributing to the Sourcegraph application.

## Vision

We want teammates and contributors to be delighted by the experience of working on Sourcegraphâ€”to have a feeling so strong that it becomes a key contributor to their happiness and an asset in our recruitment of new teammates.

What is a delightful experience for developers exactly? While it's different for everyone, these experiences all share common traits: reproducibility, predictability, short feedback loop, previewing changes.

Engineers should be able to spend their time solving problems that matter to them and focus on their goals.

## Guiding principles

We inherit Sourcegraph's [engineering principles and practices](../../../../departments/product-engineering/engineering/process/principles-and-practices.md) and [Enablement org's principles and practices](../../../../departments/product-engineering/engineering/enablement/index.md#principles-and-practices). In addition, the following principles guide the work we do in dev experience. Sometimes adhering to one causes us to compromise another, but they guide our decisions on what matters.

- **We don't own the developer experience at Sourcegraph â€“ we simply focus on it.** Sourcegraph engineers own the developer experience as a collective.
- **We ship open products.** Our products are open to contributions to anyone in the company, documented, and provide migration paths if necessary. Our decisions are clearly and publicly communicated for everyone to understand our reasoning. We want to make it simple for everyone to benefit from and work on Sourcegraphâ€™s developer experience.
- **We bandage first, then plan for surgery.** Fix local problems first, then generalize if and only if it makes sense.
  - What we cannot take upon right now, we make its status clear and provide stewardship.
    - We should never refuse to fix a "now" problem in favour of a long-term solution, only to cancel the fix because the priorities changed in between. More than not addressing the issue at hand, it prevents our users from fixing the problem for themselves in the meantime.
  - We deliver small and iterative experiments and collect feedback. We communicate regularly on their status to enable others to provide inputs. We should reap the benefits of what we work on as we go, not at the end.
- **We listen and observe.** Our users often know best what's immediately good for them because they are the ones experiencing it every day.
  We are not a dependency. We actively seek to avoid blocking product teams. We focus on improving and expediting progress, not being critical to it.

## Measuring success

To help us understand if weâ€™re going in the right direction and to measure the progress weâ€™re making, we want to use the following indicators:

- ðŸŽ¯ The main pipeline is consistently green for at least 23 hours/day
- ðŸŽ¯ Red builds on the pipeline are caused by legitimate test failures, not the lower level infrastructure they're running on
- ðŸŽ¯ Total build time on main is within ~5 minuts of previous deployment model
