# Frontend Platform strategy

The [Frontend Platform team](../../../../../frontend-platform/, by the nature of their purpose, does not follow a traditional product roadmap and instead focuses on high-impact projects aligned with the company's OKRs.

## Mission

To empower all users and Sourcegraph frontend developers to achieve maximum efficiency and effectiveness by enabling and building a first-class web experience.

## Vision

Using and developing Sourcegraph is effortless.

- We have a frictionless developer experience that empowers our frontend engineers to achieve the maximum value from the time spent on development.
- We have an intuitive, performant, and consistent user experience that makes Sourcegraph an indispensable part of every developer workflow.
