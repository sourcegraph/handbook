# Content Platform strategy

This page outlines the vision, strategy, and goals of the Content Platform team.

## Mission, Vision & Guiding Principles

### Mission

Create, manage, and optimize the content platforms that enable the success of Sourcegraph’s business objectives.

The current existing content platforms include:

- [Marketing site](https://about.sourcegraph.com)
- [Blog](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/)
- [Learn site](https://learn.sourcegraph.com)
- [Handbook](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com)
- [Docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com)

### Guiding principles

1. **Customer-first:** we exist to enable our customers to succeed against their objectives.
1. **Empowerment:** we build everything to empower the customer to be self-sufficient in managing the content.
1. **Forward-thinking:** we execute on our customers’ requests, keeping the overall content ecosystem in mind to drive efficiency and re-use.
1. **Indexability:** Search engines’ ability to index the content is not an afterthought and is key to success.
1. **High-quality:** The content platforms are the face of Sourcegraph to the public, and given our developer-focused audience, only the highest quality of engineering will be acceptable.

## Where we are now

We intend to form a self-sufficient engineering team with all the necessary cross-functional roles to deliver on the mission.

We envision driving two workstreams inside of the team, one focused on the more traditional markdown-driven content architecture (handbook, docs) and one around CMS-driven content (marketing, blog, learn). By looking at our platforms from a content-neutral way, we still believe there are many shared elements between all the sites and want to optimize for efficiency. Also, if/when needs of the handbook and docs sites diverge more drastically from the other sites to the point where it causes inefficiency in the team, we will treat it as a signal that it is time to evaluate whether to split the team.

This team will be successful if it can deliver on its customers’ needs to help them achieve their goals. Streamlining the prioritization and delivery of work while enabling self-service ability is essential. Ultimately, meeting the delivery commitments on time will determine the team’s success.

### Customers

The Content Platform team has the following customers:

1. Marketing department: The marketing, blog, and learn sites.
1. Content Platform: The handbook site
1. Product department: The docs site
1. Docs team: The docs site
