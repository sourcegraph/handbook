# Mission & Vision

## Mission

Our mission (which we do choose to accept) is to ensure that Sourcegraph’s most critical prerequisite to providing awesome customer value—access to code—is robust, stable and meets the needs of our customers, both directly and in how it underpins everything else in Sourcegraph.

## Vision

> Our support of code hosts scales to the biggest companies with minimal customization or friction. Sourcegraph engineers are able to interact with the components that facilitate access to code in a consistent and simple way, enabling new functionality to be built to support all code management systems with little-to-no customization. Sourcegraph is easily set up to access any code management system, regardless of type. Sourcegraph functionality works with any code, from anywhere.
