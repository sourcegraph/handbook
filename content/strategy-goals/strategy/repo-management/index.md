# Mission & Vision

## Mission

Our mission is to ensure that Sourcegraph "just works" with the code hosts that our customers use. Whether customers use GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Perforce, or the many other code hosts that exist, we ensure their code syncs with Sourcegraph without them worrying about it.

# Detailed Roadmap

The Repository Management team work in the [Job Fair](../../../departments/engineering/job-fair.md) model of prioritization for planning work. Internal Sourcegraph employees can see the [full set of Job Fair projects](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/302) currently approved.
