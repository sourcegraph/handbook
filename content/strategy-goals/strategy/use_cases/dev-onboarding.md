# Developer onboarding

## Why

One of the fundamental principles of developer onboarding and velocity relates to confidence, and confidence comes from understanding. There are many other factors that form part of the overall effectiveness of developer onboarding and velocity, however, as far as what Sourcegraph’s role is in relation to it, we will constrain it to the idea of understanding code.

If we unpack this a bit further, understanding relates to:

1. Being able to form a clear mental model of the overall system (i.e. knowing the various parts and how they relate)
1. Knowing where the code is or being able to find it
1. Knowing what dependencies there are on the code (i.e. what would be the impact of changing the code)
1. Knowing what dependencies the code depends on (i.e. internal/external libraries used)
1. Knowing who is responsible for or has contextual knowledge about the code
1. Knowing who updated the code and why

This kind of understanding is central to both onboarding and velocity, and research shows that revenue growth among companies who invest in the velocity of their developers see revenue growth upto 4-5 times faster than those who don’t.

## Vision

Sourcegraph anchors onboarding inside engineering organizations and enables engineers to dive into unfamiliar code and get to "first bug fix or feature" quickly. With Soucegraph integrated in the developers workflow they see increased velocity in their work over their peers that do not integrate Sourcegraph in their workflow.

## How we solve this today

Today we do not specifically focus on solving this problem, however we know from speaking with existing customers they use Sourcegraph to enhance developer onboarding & velocity. Below are two case studies further elaborating these notions.

[Indeed accelrates developmeent velocity](https://about.sourcegraph.com/case-studies/indeed-accelerates-development-velocity/)

Despite the lack of deliberate focus on solving this problem, the following are real, anonymized quotes from customers today on how we’re already helping them with this use case:

- Sourcegraph is our answer for sharing information and facilitating easy collaboration across teams, despite the boundaries of distance and time
- There’s all these little hidden things that tax the velocity of the teams. Earlier this month I was using Sourcegraph to find code and things we needed to replace, related to updating our build system, and we’ve seen an improvement in the build times as a result. But I feel like the summation of all these little things actually adds up to way more than just speeding up the build time.
- Sourcegraph increases the efficiency and confidence of our entry level developers when they build features that touch different parts of our code base.
- For our new developers, Sourcegraph has been invaluable to get to know the repository structure, to track down where code lives, and self-service during their investigations.

## Who benefits
