# Code Graph strategy

Code Graph comprises teams working on [Search](./search/index.md), [Code Insights](./code-insights/index.md), [Code Intelligence](./code-intelligence/index.md), and [Batch Changes](./batch-changes/index.md); this page describes the mission and strategy that ties them together, but each linked page provides a more detailed strategy for that team. There is also a whole-company [Sourcegraph strategy](../index.md) and [Product & Engineering strategy](../../../departments/product-engineering/strategy-goals/index.md) to which all of this is aligned.

## Mission

Make discovering, learning, and editing code easier, no matter how complex it is, where it's stored, or how experienced you are.

## Themes

We are focused over the next year on several themes across Code Graph to make our mission a reality. Our [roadmap tracker](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/214/views/34) (internal only) shows where we are headed over the next year in more detail.

### Make the power of our features easier to find and use

Getting the most out of our product can take time as you get up to speed with what's possible. Making it easier to learn will help teams find the value more quickly than today. Our task is to find a way to make interacting with multiple languages and repositories easy to understand.

### Level up our enterprise-ready features

How pricing, upgrade paths, auditing, single sign-on, access control, etc. work are essential to our customers with complex organizations. In partnership with our Cloud team, we're focused on ensuring we exceed their needs so that rolling out Sourcegraph is easy to do.

### Enable our use cases

By orienting about our [use cases](../index.md#use-cases) we will deliver solutions that are more than the sum of their parts. Our product area is central to realizing the value of most of them, so we're focused on improving how we ship features across team boundaries to make them better and better.

## Principles

There are a few key principles that inform how we think about the features we build:

- üåç **Universal**: It should make the entire universe of available code searchable, and it should be available to every developer, regardless of skill level.
- üí° **Easy to use**: The learning curve should be smooth. Code can be complicated, but we strive to make the search experience as painless and intuitive as possible.
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Accessible**: Everyone deserves access to high quality information about code; as such, our interface should be accessible.
- üöÄ **Fast**: For our product to be effective, it must be fast. We will continually improve our performance regardless of the size and complexity of data we index.
- ‚úÖ **Relevant**: In order to be useful, we need to be relevant. Our features will be the most accurate, relevant, and informative results possible.
- üß† **Educational**: For everyone to be able to code, we need to foster a culture of knowledge sharing. We are in a unique position to leverage search to increase code sharing and education, empowering communities of self-learners.
- üî¨ **Innovative**: On top of building features that are immediately useful to customers, invest in key technology areas that drive Sourcegraph's long term product differentiation and defensibility, such as Code Intelligence's technology and indexing capabilitie and Code Search's compute platform.

### Abstraction vs. complexity

According to [The Case for 'Developer Experience'](https://future.a16z.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/) (by [Jean Yang](https://twitter.com/jeanqasaur)), there are two ways to think about categories of developer tools or features today:

- Abstraction tools, which simplify tasks by providing building blocks, sane defaults, and frameworks to build on; most existing developer tools are of this variety.
- Complexity-exploring tools, which help with complex problems such as finding and fixing issues in existing, heterogeneous software systems. I.e., ones that were created using the existing tools developers use today, with different languages, frameworks, and versions in constant flux, all interacting with each other.

We see Sourcegraph playing an important role in this emerging need for complexity-exploring tooling. "The reality is that software tech stacks today look more like a rainforest‚Äîwith animals and plants co-existing, competing, living, dying, growing, interacting in unplanned ways‚Äîthan like a planned garden" ([_The Case for 'Developer Experience' by Jean Yang_][1]), and we are designing our user experience to let you embrace this complexity rather than hiding it. Practically, this means a few things as we think about how to strike this balance:

1. Sourcegraph fits in to your existing ecosystem ‚Äì wherever you host your code, whatever language it's in, or however many repos you use.
1. By surfacing relationships (not just code itself, but data types, configuration, and more) we help you build a clear, meaningful model of your software.
1. We make this information easy to explore by revealing complexity as needed, with the most relevant information up front, easy to understand, and easy to share.

If we achieve these, we make it easy for developers to get things done and, ultimately, ship great code.
