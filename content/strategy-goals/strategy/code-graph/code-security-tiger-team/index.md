# Code Security tiger team strategy

The purpose of the Code Security [tiger team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_team) is to iterate quickly with customers over new user flows addressing the [Fixing security vulnerabilities use case](../../use-cases/fixing-security-vulnerabilities.md) over FY23Q2.

Our strategy is work in progress, but we will focus heavily on running customer discovery in May.

#### What success means

We are in customer discovery phase, and will define a success metric later on. Our main business goals are:

- Close deals faster (with focused, quicker new business lands), and a reduced average sales cycle
- Attach to a compelling event
- Fill a meaningful gap in the current security tool landscape
- Create incremental and meaningful value for our customers
- Provide a new buyer to land with in target accounts
