# Admin Experience Strategy

## Mission

Our mission is to provide the fastest, most seamless way for development teams to bring Sourcegraph into their workflows. Going form 0 -> 1 with Sourcegraph should be intuitive and straight-forward. Our persona focus is Sourcegraph admins that deploy, configure, and maintain products and tools within their organizations

## FY23 Strategy

The Admin Experience FY23 strategy is still TBD. Until then, see [Product & Engineering strategy](../../../departments/engineering/strategy-goals/index.md).
