# Cloud SaaS goals and priorities

## Goals

### Private code on Sourcegraph Cloud

**Problem:** Customers who want to use Sourcegraph with their private code must setup and run a Sourcegraph instance on their own compute infrastructure. There are customers who want to use Sourcegraph but don't want to have to deploy and operate their own Sourcegraph instance and associated compute infrastructure. These customers expect to be able to search over only the code they care about, and are not inundated with public or irrelevant code. To host private code on Sourcegraph Cloud, we need to not only ensure the security of our product (which is important for on-premises deployments too), but we also have to ensure the security of our Sourcegraph Cloud infrastructure.

**Milestones:**

1. âœ… The Sourcegraph team members can add public code from GitHub.com and GitLab.com.

## Roadmap

The Cloud project roadmap is tracked in [productboard](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/feature-board/2119755-cloud)

## New user experience

The Cloud SaaS team also works on the [new user experience](../../../../departments/product-engineering/process/new-user-experience.md) using our [cross-team collaboration principles](../../../../departments/product-engineering/process/cross-org-team-collab.md).
