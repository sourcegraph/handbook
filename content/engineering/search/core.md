## Iterations

The search core team plans its work in **2-week iterations**.

**Team syncs, plans and updates:**

- The teams holds syncs thrice weekly (M, W, F).
- Before team syncs, teammates add their status and plans to the [team sync meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cTdGC4jBK7aEnb9ChzCLYHVGBpRRMNYGdUUPYVPIWHo/edit#).
- The team discusses the updates live during the sync.
- Updates should be in prose and communicate progress made and pain points.

### Planning an iteration

Iterations start **every other Monday**.

**On the last Friday of an iteration:**

- The team holds its [retrospective](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bzBJh-zPOw0_lZ-TbMpnAx-do5CoCTL8Z2V74WU-Rew/edit) for the previous iteration.

**On the first Monday of an iteration:**

- The team reviews the iteration plan during the team sync, and kicks off the iteration.
