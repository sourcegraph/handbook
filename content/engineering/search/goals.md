# Search goals and priorities

This page documents the current goals and priorities of the [Search team](index.md). See also our [completed goals](goals_completed.md).

## Search product goals

### Deliver search contexts to solve version context pain points for enterprise customers

**Timeline:** May 2021

**Problem:** Users should be able to search code they care about. The code can live in multiple repositories and we need to provide a natural way to group and search them. Our current solution, version contexts, has many known pain points.

### Drive retention on Cloud through search UX improvements

**Timeline:** FQ2

**Problem:** When attempting to use Sourcegraph for public code, users struggle with search syntax and discovering search use cases, leading to poor retention.

## Search core backend goals
### Sourcegraph Cloud returns valuable results on 5M repositories

**Timeline:** October 1

**Problem:** in order for Sourcegraph to become the code search engine for public code, its global index needs to include a large enough sample of popular public repositories.
