  This deployment also contains all of our private code.
- [Managed instances](../distribution/managed/index.md) are deployments of Sourcegraph we manage for customers.
  - [demo.sourcegraph.com](instances.md#demo-sourcegraph-com) is a managed instance used for CE demos.
  - [devmanaged.sourcegraph.com](instances.md#devmanaged-sourcegraph-com) is a managed instance used for managed instances development.

This deployment is also colloquially referred to as "Sourcegraph Cloud", "Cloud", and "dot-com". It is the public deployment available to the public at [sourcegraph.com/search](https://sourcegraph.com/search).

`sourcegraph.com` deploys the latest changes from [`sourcegraph/sourcegraph`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph) on a schedule via [Renovate](./index.md#renovate)

This deployment also includes our [documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/) and [about](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) sites.

> 🐶 For dogfooding changes, use [k8s.sgdev.org](#k8s-sgdev-org) instead, which generally receives updates faster.
