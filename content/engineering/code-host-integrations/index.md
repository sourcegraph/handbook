# Code host integrations team

**The code host integrations team does not yet exist**. It is a team we want to create & grow. Responsibilities of the code host integrations team are currently owned by the [../web/index.md](web team).

## Vision

The **browser extension** and code host **native integrations** are a breeze to set up, and add compelling value when reading or reviewing code. Enabling native code host integrations for all users is a no-brainer for site admins.
