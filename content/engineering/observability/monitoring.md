## Overview

Monitoring at Sourcegraph encapsulates:

- How site admins know something _is wrong_ or _may be wrong_.
- Describing the overall health of Sourcegraph to site admins.
- Making it clear to site admins _where to go next if Sourcegraph is not healthy._

It does not include:

- Significant detail about what went wrong: the goal is just to direct the site admin to the next step.
- Solving a problem end-to-end: after looking at monitoring, admins MUST go elsewhere to solve the problem.
- Identifying individual problem cases (e.g. the details of why a single request failed).

Monitoring is just one piece of Sourcegraph's observability. See the [observability developer guide](index.md) for more information.

### Monitoring pillars

To learn more about our monitoring goals and principles, refer to: [monitoring pillars](monitoring_pillars.md).

### Monitoring architecture

To learn more about our monitoring stack and architecture, refer to: [monitoring architecture](./monitoring_architecture.md).

## Adding monitoring

There are some steps involved, but it's easy and the development process is quite seamless:

1. Get your Prometheus metric merged in our main codebase. You can find [examples](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+prometheus.MustRegister%28&patternType=literal) throughout our code, and [learn about the Proemtheus metric types](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/).
   - If you are doing this for a new service, also refer to [tracking a new service](#tracking-a-new-service).
2. Use the Grafana Explore page [on Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com/-/debug/grafana/explore), [k8s.sgdev.org](https://k8s.sgdev.org/-/debug/grafana/explore), or [your local development server](http://localhost:3080/-/debug/grafana/explore) to start writing your Prometheus query.
3. Make a guess about what a good/bad value for your query is. It's OK if this isn't perfect, just do your best. Some examples:
   - `Warning: Alert{GreaterOrEqual: 50}`
   - `Warning: Alert{LessOrEqual: 50}`
4. Run a Sourcegraph `dev/start.sh` server and [visit Grafana](http://localhost:3080/-/debug/grafana).
5. Look for an existing dashboard that your information should go in. Think "when this number shows something bad, which service's logs are likely to be most relevant?"
6. Open that service's monitoring definition (e.g. `monitoring/frontend.go`, `monitoring/git_server.go`) in your editor.
7. Declare your [`Observable`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40master+file:%5Emonitoring/+type+Observable&patternType=literal) by adding it to [an existing `Row` in the file](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@64aa473/-/blob/monitoring/frontend.go#L12-43), or by adding a new [`Row`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40master+file:%5Emonitoring/+type+Row&patternType=literal) or [`Group`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40master+file:%5Emonitoring/+type+Group&patternType=literal) entirely. Here's an example `Observable` to get you started:

```go
{
    Name:        "99th_percentile_search_request_duration",
    Description: "99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m",
    Query:       `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le)(rate(search_request_duration{status="success}[5m])))`,
    Warning:     Alert{GreaterOrEqual: 20},
}
```

As soon as you save the file, everything is regenerated by `dev/start.sh` (Grafana dashboards, Prometheus alerting rules, documentation, etc.) and you can simply refresh on the dashboard you're editing to see your changes.

### Configure panel options

There are not many panel options (intentionally) to keep things simple. The primary thing you'll use is to change the Grafana display from plain numbers to a unit like seconds:

```diff
{
    Name:        "99th_percentile_search_request_duration",
    Description: "99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m",
    Query:       `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le)(rate(search_request_duration{status="success}[5m])))`,
    Warning:     Alert{GreaterOrEqual: 20},
+   PanelOptions: PanelOptions().LegendFormat("duration").Unit(Seconds),
}
```

This step is optional, but highly recommended.

### Add solution documentation

It's best if you also add some Markdown documentation with your best guess of what someone _might consider doing_ if they observe the alert firing (again, just your best guess is good enough here):

```diff
{
    Name:        "99th_percentile_search_request_duration",
    Description: "99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m",
    Query:       `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le)(rate(search_request_duration{status="success}[5m])))`,
    Warning:     Alert{GreaterOrEqual: 20},
    PanelOptions: PanelOptions().LegendFormat("duration").Unit(Seconds),
+	PossibleSolutions: `
+       - Look at the 'frontend' logs for details on the slow search queries.
+   `,
}
```

> **Tip:** In `PossibleSolutions` Markdown, you can use single quotes anywhere you would normally use backticks for code, and indention will automatically be removed for you.

Once you save the file, `doc/admin/observability/alert_solutions.md` will automatically be regenerated and you can even preview your changes at [http://localhost:5080/admin/observability/alert_solutions](http://localhost:5080/admin/observability/alert_solutions).

This step is optional, but highly recommended.

### Tracking a new service

Metrics should be made available over HTTP for [Prometheus](./monitoring_architecture.md#sourcegraph-prometheus) to scrape. By default, Prometheus expects metrics to be exported on `$SERVICEPORT/metrics` - for example, run your local Sourcegraph dev server and metrics should be available on `http://localhost:$SERVICEPORT/metrics`.

In [deploy-sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph), Prometheus uses the Kubernetes API to discover endpoints to scrape. Just add the following annotations to your service definition:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/port: "$SERVICEPORT" # replace with the port your service runs on 
    sourcegraph.prometheus/scrape: "true"
```

In [deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker), Prometheus relies on targets defined in the [`prometheus_targets`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/prometheus/prometheus_targets.yml) configuration file - you will need to add your service here.

## Grafana

Sourcegraph uses a custom Grafana image, [`sourcegraph/grafana`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/master/docker-images/grafana), which contains minor changes from the vanilla Grafana image. Learn more about its role in our overall monitoring architecture [here](./monitoring_architecture.md#sourcegraph-grafana).

### Connecting Grafana to a remote Prometheus instance

You may wish to connect Grafana to a remote Prometheus instance, like Sourcegraph.com, to show more real data than is available on your dev server. You may do so by getting `kubectl` connected to a Sourcegraph cluster and then port-forwarding via:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 30090:30090
```

Then make one of the following changes to the Grafana development datasources:

* `url: http://host.docker.internal:30090` in [`dev/all/prometheus`](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@master/-/blob/dev/grafana/all/prometheus.yaml) (non-Linux)
* `url: http://127.0.0.1:30090` in [`dev/linux/prometheus`](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@master/-/blob/dev/grafana/linux/prometheus.yaml) (Linux)

and rerun `./dev/start.sh` or `./enterprise/dev/start.sh`.

If you want to avoid spinning up in the entire Sourcegraph stack and just want to look at Grafana, you can also use `./dev/grafana.sh`. You can skip the datasource change above and just use the following port-forward to take the place of the normal development Prometheus instance and run a standalone Grafana instance:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:30090 -n prod
./dev/grafana.sh
```

### Upgrading Grafana

To upgrade Grafana, make the appropriate version change to the [`sourcegraph/grafana` Dockerfile](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40master+FROM+grafana/grafana:.*&patternType=regexp) and make sure to:

* Run `dev/start.sh` and verify that all generated Grafana dashboards still render correctly

## Prometheus and Alertmanager

Sourcegraph uses a custom Prometheus image, [`sourcegraph/prometheus`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/master/docker-images/prometheus), that bundles Alertmanager and a wrapper program for managing configuration changes. Learn more about its role in our overall monitoring architecture [here](./monitoring_architecture.md#sourcegraph-prometheus).

### Find available metrics

If you need to find where metrics are declared or updated you can use Sourcegraph itself to search if you have a metric name. Sometimes
the metrics are hard to find because their name declarations are not literal strings but are concatenated instead in code from variables.
You can try a specialized tool called `promgrep` to find them. Run the tool in the root `sourcegraph/sourcegraph` source directory.

```
$ go get github.com/sourcegraph/promgrep
$ promgrep <some_partial_metric_name>
```

If you run it in an Emacs shell buffer or in GoLand terminal then the results are clickable and get you to the locations in code
where the metrics are declared.

Running `promgrep` without any arguments lists all declared metrics.

### Upgrading Prometheus or Alertmanager

To upgrade Prometheus or Alertmanager, make the appropriate version and sum changes to the [`sourcegraph/prometheus` Dockerfile](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40master+%28FROM+prom/prometheus:%29.*+OR+%28FROM+prom/alertmanager:%29.*&patternType=regexp) and make sure to:

* Upgrade the [Alertmanager and Prometheus Go client dependencies](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40master+file:go.mod+alertmanager+OR+prometheus/client_golang&patternType=literal), and make sure everything still builds
* Run `dev/start.sh` and verify that:
  * all generated Grafana dashboards still render (`localhost:3370`)
  * all Prometheus rules are evaluated (`localhost:9090/rules`)
  * Alertmanager starts up correctly (`localhost:9090/alertmanager/#/status`) and can be configured via `observability.alerts`
