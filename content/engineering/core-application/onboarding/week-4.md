## Activities

Congratulations on wrapping up your first month! This week is about [continuously growing](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/values#continuously-grow), and continuing to make Sourcegraph [welcoming and inclusive](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/values#be-welcoming-and-inclusive).

Here's where you'll spend your time in week 4:

- **Give an architecture presentation:** Now it's your turn to teach us! Using the [Sourcegraph architecture diagram](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/architecture), present a lunch-and-learn to the team about how Sourcegraph works. We'll help fill in any gaps, and probably learn a few things ourselves!
- **Improve one or more service tours:** Based on your experiences so far, improve one or more of our [service tours](index.md#service-tours). It doesn't matter how large or small the change, just find something you think is worth sharing and make it available to others.
- **Help us improve onboarding:** Onboarding is forever a work-in-progress. Each new hire gets to approach the situation with fresh eyes and give us actionable feedback, so tell us how onboarding worked for you. What should we stop, start or continue doing? How can we pave the road more smoothly for the next hire?

## Outcomes

At the end of the week, you'll have achieved the following outcomes:

1. You'll have sufficient knowledge to train others on Sourcegraph's architecture.
2. You'll understand how to navigate our systems and services fluidly.
3. You'll [leave the campground better than you found it](https://deviq.com/principles/boy-scout-rule) for the next employee.
