## Introduction

The first days and weeks on a new team can be daunting. There's a lot of information to absorb, and sometimes it feels like catching up to everyone else is going to be a challenge.

[Don't panic!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don't_Panic) We've set up these onboarding materials to help ease you into your role, and you'll find that your coworkers are more than happy to assist you however they can. We don't expect you to become an expert overnight â€” take some time to read the materials, experiment with the code and ask us lots of questions!

> Please ensure you've familiarized yourself with the [General Onboarding](../../../people-ops/onboarding/index.md#for-all-new-teammates) and [Engineering Onboarding](../../onboarding/index.md#engineering-onboarding) documents. The materials on this page are geared toward the [Core Application team](../index.md).

## Onboarding goals and milestones

Your onboarding will take 3 months. After this time, you should acquire the necessary domain knowledge and experience that will allow you to succeed in the role of a [software engineer](../../roles.md#software-engineer) within your [seniority level](../../career-development/framework.md#levels). This process is a team effort, and your success depends not only on your actions but also on full support from your team and manager.

To keep things more organized and clarify what you should expect, we are applying 30/60/90 days patterns and breaking down the onboarding process into 3 milestones with defined themes and outcomes.

### First month

The central theme for the first month is **learning**. During these 30 days, your goal is to acquire the **foundation domain knowledge** about our product, processes, architecture, and code base that will **help you feel comfortable and be effective in the role** of a [software engineer](../../roles.md#software-engineer) in the Core Application team.

You will meet many people, read multiple documents, solve small, well-defined technical challenges, and be exposed to a ton of new information. We understand this might feel overwhelming, so please relax and don't stress. This first month is the time for [learning and growth](../../../company/values.md#continuously-grow).

### Second month

We will give you more **ownership** and opportunities to make an impact. While learning will still be the central theme, you can expect more complex problems to solve. You will also get your **first project assigned**, requiring you to collaborate with other teams, think about planning, execution, risk management, technical design, and other factors.

You will start **shadowing** your peers during the **[operational rotation](../operational-rotation.md)** so that you can become comfortable and effective in this role and start participating in the process during the next month.

With the domain knowledge and business context you have acquired so far, it's an excellent opportunity to **start making an impact on the team**. We expect your honest **feedback** about our current processes, tooling, architecture, code base, product goals, etc. Please be [proactive in sharing your **ideas**](../../../company/values.md#high-agency) on how we can improve in a spirit of **continuous improvement**.

### Third month

Time is running fast, and you learned a lot. You feel productive and autonomous, and your contributions are making a real impact on the team. It's time to provide you with more **leadership** opportunities.

We would like you to take the role of a **Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)** for a given project. DRIs are empowered and accountable for the success of the initiative they lead. The scope and complexity of the problem to solve will depend on your seniority level. While you likely won't be the only person working on this project, it's up to you to make sure it gets done and that you have all resources necessary. Being a DRI might sound challenging and stressful, especially during your first months at Sourcegraph. Don't worry; your buddy, peers, and team's triad (Project Manager, Project Designer, and Engineering Manager) are here to help and support you. The goal is to give you the sense of responsibility, ownership, and experience of wearing different hats.

This month, you will also switch to **active participation in [operational rotation](../operational-rotation.md)** and join the team's rotation [schedule](https://sourcegraph.app.opsgenie.com/settings/schedule/detail/b553cefc-2466-4ad2-ad0c-66937c790bbf). Please do not forget that your peers are here to help, and you can rely on their support and guidance, especially during your first shift.

Finally, we would like you to start **shadowing** your team members during **on-call rotation** and participate in responding to and resolving production incidents. This experience will prepare you for performing on-call duty once you finish your onboarding process.

## Onboarding by Week

The core application team owns services that are fundamental to Sourcegraph's operations. It's an important responsibility that's both exciting and challenging. To that end, we've defined the following timeline to help you focus on what matters the most at each step of your onboarding journey.

- [Week 1](week-1.md)
- [Week 2](week-2.md)
- [Week 3](week-3.md)
- [Week 4](week-4.md)
