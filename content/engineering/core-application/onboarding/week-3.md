## Activities

You're halfway done with your first month at Sourcegraph! Time flies, doesn't it? This week is about helping you deliver with [high agency](../../../company/values.md#high-agency) and [high quality](../../../company/values.md#high-quality).

Here's where you'll spend your time in week 3:

- **Participate in iteration planning:** Now that you have some hands-on experience with the Sourcegraph project, help us plan and estimate the upcoming iteration. Don't worry about pinpoint accuracy - we want to hear your voice and your contributions, and we'll help guide you.
- **Tackle larger work:** Based on iteration planning, pick up work that seems challenging (or even daunting, just not impossible). We're here to help you be successful, so stretch a little bit and operate outside your comfort zone. Call on your onboarding buddy or the team at large if you get stuck.
- **Take further service tours:** Last week, you took one of our [service tours](index.md#service-tours) and discussed what you learned with your onboarding buddy. Select a different one and do the same thing this week. Additionally, relate this service tour to the previous one - how / why do these services connect, what data is being operated upon, etc.

## Outcomes

At the end of the week, you'll have achieved the following outcomes:

1. You'll have influenced the upcoming iteration, and helped us define where we go next.
2. You'll have the confidence to take on more complex, challenging tasks.
3. You'll be able to more deeply discuss our services and their interactions.
