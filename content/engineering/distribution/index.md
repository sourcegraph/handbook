# Distribution team

# Distribution are no longer 1 team and have devided into three teams.

While these pages still remian (due to a lot of useful resources that have yet to be migrated) there new teams are as follows:

- [Delivery](../enablement/delivery/index.md)
  - Ownership: Customer deployments, whether self-hosted or on-prem, and our customer releases of Sourcegraph
- [Developer Experience](../enablement/dev-experience/index.md)
  - Ownership: Systems and tooling for our internal engineering teams
- [Cloud Devops](../cloud/devops/index.md)
  - Ownership: sourcegraph.com health and monitoring

# Old Content

The distribution team is responsible for making Sourcegraph easy to deploy, scale, monitor, and debug. We solve the most challenging problems our customers face deploying Sourcegraph on-premise in a variety of environments, and on [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com/search) - the largest Sourcegraph instance in the world.

## Contact

- Slack: #distributioneers channel or @distribution
- For support requests, please use our dedicated [support rotation](#support-rotation)
- File issues: [team/distribution](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?labels=team/distribution) label

## Team communication

Our team has two Slack channels, one public (#distributioneers) and one private (#distribution-team). **Our default is to use the public channel**. The #distribution-team channel will only be used for discussing internal team topics, like scheduling, retrospectives, how we do updates, etc.

## Getting help from the Distribution team

### Urgent customer incidents

If you think that an incident might be impacting more than just one customer, please follow the guidance in the [incident process](../incidents/index.md).

Otherwise, if the incident is isolated to one customer (whether that be a managed instance or a self-hosted deployment) please proceed as follows.

For out of hours (or if in doubt and in need of urgent Distribution support) you can send an urgent notification to the engineer directly from Slack utilizing the following command: `/genie alert "ce/p1: Customer XYZ systems are impaired #12345" for distribution-support`.
If the engineer is unable, a message will be send to the rest of the team. Please provide a link to an [issue](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/ce/customer_issues) in any message.

During hours, please message us in Slack in the [Distributioneers channel](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/CJX299FGE) and tag `@distribution-support`. Please provide a link to an [issue](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/ce/customer_issues) in any message.

Find out [how we cover on-call](#on-call-Support).

### General questions

1. In #distributioneers, click the blue lightning bolt just below the Slack text field
2. At the top of the popup, select the type of request – "Ask a question"
3. Fill out the form!
4. Your responses will be posted in the channel, which is monitored by the member of the team on the support rotation ([see below](#how-we-cover-support-requests) for more info!)
5. We'll get back to you asap. But, if this is a **time sensitive question**, please tag `@distribution-support` in the thread in the channel.

### General (non-urgent) support requests

1. Ensure there is an GitHub issue logged for the problem
2. In #distributioneers, click the blue lightning bolt just below the Slack text field
3. At the top of the popup, select the type of request – "Request support"
4. Fill out the form!
5. Your responses will be posted in the channel, which is monitored by the member of the team on the support rotation ([see below](#how-we-cover-support-requests) for more info!)
6. We'll get back to you asap. But, if this is a **time sensitive request**, please tag `@distribution-support` in the thread in the channel, or consider using the method outlined in ["Urgent customer incidents"](#urgent-customer-incidents) above if _really_ urgent.

### How we cover support requests

Who is on-call? Slack: `/genie whoisoncall distribution-support`

_The on-call support engineer can be reached (without you needing to know who it is) by using the Slack handle `@distribution-support`._

We maintain a support rotation to deal day-to-day requests (respond to ad-hoc, time-sensitive questions from customers or other teams, RFC review requests, etc). This makes it easier for other teams to reach out an engineer on the team whose priority is being the point of contact for these questions. You can read more about this on the references below.
When you are the active support engineer, your focus and priority is responding to requests and questions in #distributioneers, sometimes this might require creating an issue, re-assigning, looping in other engineers, etc.

_Distribution Team: If for any reason you are unavailable for a rotation, please coordinate with the team for someone to take over._

**Resonsibilities**:

The on-call support engineer is responsbile for owning the communication and determining the relative priority of the issue. However, the on-call engineer is **not expected** to solve issues entirely on their own (in fact, it's encouraged to pull in the other engineers if necessary - to bounce ideas off of one another, someone else might have more expertise in this particular area, etc.).

## On-Call Support

Who is on-call? Slack: `/genie whoisoncall Distribution`

We have a 24x7 OpsGenie rotation to respond to [incidents](../incidents/index.md) (events that cause service disruption). You can find more information about [being on-call in the handbook](../incidents/on_call.md).
