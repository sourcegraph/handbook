## Setup
Set up your local development environment. 
If you encounter any issues, ask for help in #dev-chat and then update the documentation to reflect the resolution (so the next engineer that we hire doesn‚Äôt run into the same problem).
Setup Github and Configure your GitHub notifications: 
Because we are an all-remote company and favor asynchronous communication, it is important to configure your notifications correctly so that you receive and read notifications that are important (e.g. someone makes a comment on one of your PRs, someone adds you as a reviewer to a PR) without being overwhelmed by notifications that don‚Äôt involve you.
Add Sourcegraph as a browser search engine. 
To search our private code, log in to our internal dogfood instance (k8s.sgdev.org) and add another entry: https://k8s.sgdev.org/search?q=%s.
