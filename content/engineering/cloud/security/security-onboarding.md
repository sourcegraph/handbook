# Security Onboarding **üßë‚Äçüíª**


## Setup



* Set up your [local development environment](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/doc/dev/getting-started/index.md). [_If you encounter any issues, ask for help in #dev-chat and then update the documentation to reflect the resolution (so the next engineer that we hire doesn‚Äôt run into the same problem)_]
    * [Setup SG tool](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/dev/sg/README.md) 
* [Configure your GitHub notifications](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/github-notifications): 
    * Request access to Sourcegraph organization
    * Because we are an all-remote company and favor asynchronous communication, it is important to configure your notifications correctly so that you receive and read notifications that are important (e.g. someone makes a comment on one of your PRs, someone adds you as a reviewer to a PR) without being overwhelmed by notifications that don‚Äôt involve you.
* [Add Sourcegraph as a browser search engine](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/browser_search_engine). 
    * To search our private code, log in to our [internal dogfood instance](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/deployments/instances#k8s-sgdev-org) (<code>[k8s.sgdev.org](https://k8s.sgdev.org/)</code>) and add another entry: <code>[https://k8s.sgdev.org/search?q=%s](https://k8s.sgdev.org/search?q=%s)</code>.
* Request access to the services below via the listed teams:
    * GCP
        * IT-Tech-Ops
    * Buildkite
        * Self-serve via google auth
    * Sourcegraph Github repo
        * IT-Tech-Ops
    * Cloudflare
        * Security
* [Setup the google cloud CLI tool](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart) and authenticate. 
    * That is needed for terraform and kubectl.
* [Set up Terraform](https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure#first-time-using-terraform)
* [Connect to dogfood with kubectl](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/deployments/debugging/tutorial#gain-access-to-the-cluster). 
    * For prod and other clusters it‚Äôs just a matter of adding the other kubeconfigs
* Get accustomed to Buildkite
* Download and setup Burpsuite community edition on your laptop
    * You can use [this Burp project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1__fpwVbzUyuZinbrJnEJSVe3WM1ANpxQ/view?usp=sharing) already configured for Sourcegraph
* Valuable docs:
    * [Docs.sourcegraph.com](https://docs.sourcegraph.com)
    * [Secret Management Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qm5P4KbyVMP_KyPvud0qyqUb43RK3lTFMjAeE6623Nw/edit#heading=h.2xk4w97izb7i)
    * Sourcegraph demo video


## Acceptance Criteria



* You are able to run Sourcegraph code locally with dev-private
* You are able to run tf plan on the sourcegraph/infrastructure repository
* You are able to kubectl into our clusters
* Complete hands on tasks assigned to you as a starter task
* Capture traffic via Burpsuite for analysis
