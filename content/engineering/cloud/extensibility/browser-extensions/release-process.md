## Releasing Browser Extensions

### Chrome

The release process for Chrome is fully automated. The review process usually takes between half a day to a day. To check the status of the release, visit the [developer dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/7db1c88c-79ec-48c8-b14f-e17af93aee2c/dgjhfomjieaadpoljlnidmbgkdffpack/edit/package). Deployment to the Chrome web store happen automatically in CI when the `bext/release` branch is updated.

Release Steps:

1. Make sure the main branch is up-to-date. Run `git push origin main:bext/release`.
1. Pushing to the `bext/release` branch will trigger our build pipeline, which can be observed from respecting [buildkite](https://buildkite.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/builds?branch=bext%2Frelease) page.
1. Once the <code>ðŸš€<img src="https://buildkiteassets.com/emojis/img-buildkite-64/chrome.png" style="width: 1.23em; height: 1.23em; margin-left: 0.05em; margin-right: 0.05em; vertical-align: -0.2em; background-color: transparent;"/> Extension release</code> task is done, the build should appear on the [developer dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/7db1c88c-79ec-48c8-b14f-e17af93aee2c/dgjhfomjieaadpoljlnidmbgkdffpack/edit/package) with pending review status.

### Firefox

The release process for Firefox is currently semi-automated. The review process can take between half a day to multiple days. To check the status of the release, visit the [add-on developer hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/sourcegraph-for-firefox/versions).

Release Steps:

1. When the `bext/release` branch is updated, our build pipeline will trigger a build for the Firefox extension (take a note of the commit sha, we'll need it later).
1. The buildkite will, similar to Chrome, run a task named <code>ðŸš€<img src="https://buildkiteassets.com/emojis/img-buildkite-64/firefox.png" style="width: 1.23em; height: 1.23em; margin-left: 0.05em; margin-right: 0.05em; vertical-align: -0.2em; background-color: transparent;"/> Extension release</code>.
1. Once the release task is finished check the [add-on developer hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/sourcegraph-for-firefox/versions).
    1. If the currently build version is available and in "Approved" state then we are done.
    1. If it is in other state, then:
        1. We need to upload an non-minified version of the extension to the add-on developer hub.
        1. To create this non-minified package, on your local git copy, navigate to `sourcegraph/client/browser/scripts/`, open the file `create-source-zip.js`, and modify the `commitId` variable (use the sha from earlier).
        1. Once the variable is modified, run this script by `node create-source-zip.js`. It will generate a `sourcegraph.zip` in the folder.
        1. Navigate to the [add-on developer hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/sourcegraph-for-firefox/versions), click on the pending version, upload the zip that was just created and `Save Changes`.
