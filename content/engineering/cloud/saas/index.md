## Team Operating Procedure

### Working Principles

TBA

### JIRA

The team is currently experimenting with JIRA as our project tracker.

To track GitHub PRs automatically in JIRA, use the JIRA ticket number anywhere in the branch name. So for example, if the ticket number is `COREAPP-42` and you name your branch `the-answer-to-everything-COREAPP-42`, the resulting PR from this branch will automatically be associated with the JIRA ticket.
