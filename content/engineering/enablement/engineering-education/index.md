# Engineering Education team

The Engineering Education team is part of the [Enablement](../index.md) org within [Engineering](../../index.md).

## Mission

We want every engineer at Sourcegraph to feel engaged, motivated, and productive while having all the context and technical knowledge they need in order to deliver [high-quality](../../../company/values.md#high-quality) work.

We make this happen by getting engineers onboarded quickly and efficiently, providing resources and environments for engineers to [continuously grow](../../../company/values.md#continuously-grow), helping technical knowledge flow [openly and freely](../../../company/values.md#open-and-transparent) within teams and across teams, and driving a culture of learning and knowledge sharing at Sourcegraph.
