Playbooks maintained by the team:

- [CI playbook](../../incidents/playbooks/ci.md)

### Work allocation

We aim to allow teammates the flexibility to work on incoming requests, tackle proactive improvements, and invest in long-term efforts to further our [team goals](../../../company/strategy/enablement/dev-experience/index.md), so as a rule of thumb:

- We aim to spend **20% to 30%** (~2-3 days every 2 weeks) of our time on making proactive impact, i.e. working on things that are aligned with the team's mission, but aren't on our roadmap.
- If **over 50%** (~5 days every 2 weeks) of our time is spent _outside_ of planned work (i.e support requests), we opt to discuss the scope and priority of the work with the team first.

### Meetings

_This section is a work in progress._

We currently have weekly sync meetings and biweekly retrospectives.
