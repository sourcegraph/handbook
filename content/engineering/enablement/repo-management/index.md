# Repo Management team

The Repo Management team is part of the [Enablement](../index.md) org.

## Mission

Our mission is to maintain and evolve the methods by which code is pulled into Sourcegraph from code hosts, in a way that supports all required functionality while maximizing performance, reliability, and ease of use.

We also have temporary custody of Authentication, with the aspiration being to split the team to give auth a dedicated team to own it.

## Principles
