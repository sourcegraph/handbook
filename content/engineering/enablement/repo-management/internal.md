# Internal

This page contains information that is mostly interesting to members of the Repo Management team.

## Rhythm of the Team

Document things we do as a team to engage with each other, deliver more effectively, and grow together

## Mechanisms

The following are mechanisms we use to stay in sync. We favor asynchoronous mechanisms whenever possible to respect the working hours of teammates.

1. [Meeting] Bi-weekly Planning and Retro: Every two weeks we plan our upcoming work in our [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/209/views/1).
2. [Meeting] Bi-weekly Sync: We meet to discuss what everyone is working on, high priority issues that may have come through, blockers, and in-flight support.
3. [Async] Monthly Status Update: Every month the EM sends a status update with all of the highlights, challenges, and news currently impacting the team. This drives alignment with leadership and celebrates our wins.
4. [Async] Standup Update: Every morning, the geekbot Slack bot prompts a standup update. Every team member answers it (during their morning) and it automatically posts to the team Slack channel.
