# Repo Management Processes

## Support

Repo management handles our support without a rota - that is to say there is no dedicated engineer on support duties, instead work is picked up by anyone in the team.

### Requesting our support

**Simple questions guidelines:**

Feel free to direct simple questions to us in [#repo-management](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02EDAQAJQZ) in Slack

- This channel is regularly checked
- So please do **NOT** directly message or CC an engineer - this is to try and protect their focus
- Instead, if it's urgent, please @ either [the PM or the EM](index.md#members) in the question in the channel

**Support request guidelines:**

Support requests related to our [areas of ownership](index.md#responsibilities) should follow this process:

1. Make sure there is an issue - if there's not, please create one and include:
   - A short description of the ask
   - A more detailed explanation of the background, the context and the channelneg that needs solving
   - Any guidance related to the impact this is having
   - Any extra information that could help us solve or prioritize this
2. Ensure lable `team/repo-management` is added to the issue
3. Ensure that the issue is added to the "[Repo Management](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/209)" board in GitHub
4. This board is checked weekly - so this is enough for feature requests or less urgent issues
5. If you think this needs eyes ðŸ‘€ sooner, please message in [#repo-management](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02EDAQAJQZ) in Slack and CC [the PM or the EM](index.md#members)
