## Introduction

Welcome to Sourcegraph and Repo Management! We are all excited to have you join the team. You will spend the next few months learning a lot, meeting new people, and delivering value to our customers. Don't worry if it feels like a lot to learn; we're all here to help at any time. Repo Management, like the rest of Sourcegraph, is predicated on [High Agency](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company/values#high-agency): you have our full support to take ownership over your onboarding and the team.

This onboarding guide will provide the frame and you will paint the rest of the picture as time goes on. Don't forget to check out the Sourcegraph-wide [General Onboarding](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/people-ops/onboarding#for-all-new-teammates) and [Engineering Onboarding](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/engineering/onboarding#engineering-onboarding) documents.
