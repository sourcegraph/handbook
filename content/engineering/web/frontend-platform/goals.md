# Frontend platform Goals and Priorities 

## Goals

See also our [completed goals](goals_completed.md).

### Make the web app UI consistent, accessible, and scalable 

**Problem:** 

The Sourcegraph web platform has accumulated lots of design debt, since much of it was built before we had a design team. Additionally, the existing UI components don't scale to Sourcegraph's feature growth. The web platform should be more accessible, delightful, customizable, and scalable in order to empower Sourcegraph's users and Sourcegraph's internal teams' development.

### Milestones: 
1. 🔄 Sourcegraph's core navigation effectively highlights our core features and scales to new ones. 
   - **Outcome:** We have a defined path forward for expanding navigation to include new features without needing to frequently redesign. 

1. Sourcegraph's UI lets users customize themes, colors, and font attributes. 
   - **Outcome:**  The Sourcegraph UI meets all WCAG accessibility standards. 

1. Sourcegraph's UI components are clean and intentionally designed.
   - **Outcome:** The Sourcegraph frontend is easy for other teams to develop on top of. 
   - **Outcome:** The Sourcegraph UI contributes to the Sourcegraph brand to the point where it is clear what "feels like" and "does not feel like" Sourcegraph, per qualitative feedback from internal teams.
