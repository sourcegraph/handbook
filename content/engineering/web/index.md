# Web team

[Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit#heading=h.g2wq4qci7wj0)

## Vision

**The web team is a transitional team**, designed to be split into the following mission teams:

- [Web infrastructure](../web-infrastructure/index.md)
- [Extensibility](../extensibility/index.md)
- [Code host integrations](../code-host-integrations/index.md)

Its mission today is closest to that of the [web infrastructure](../web-infrastructure/index.md) team.

We are working on hiring for these teams, so that we can achieve our desired team structure.

## Focus

Each iteration, the web team splits its focus as follows:

- ~30-40% quick wins: these are small but impactful tasks. They may come from product, design, analytics, customer engineering, or be technical debt / engineering investment tasks.
- ~60-70% focused goal: we'll agree on a single, focused goal that we can work on as a team. Depending on priorities, this may be a product goal, or an engineering investment.

The web team's current focus is documented in the tracking issue for the current milestone.

## Contact

- #web channel or @web-team in Slack.
- [team/web](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?labels=team/web) label and [@sourcegraph/web](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/web) team on GitHub.

## Tech stack

TypeScript, React, RxJS, GraphQL, Go.

## Processes

We do [weekly check-ins](../tracking_issues.md#using-a-tracking-issue-for-progress-check-ins) (between Friday EOD and Monday 5am PT) and [planning](../tracking_issues.md#planning-a-milestone-with-a-tracking-issue) with [tracking issues](../tracking_issues.md).

## Team syncs

The web team holds weekly syncs.

The meeting notes of web team syncs can be found [in this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1IUsjbtYdGiAHvRUB1yf4eqnynin9WsxFR2zFCMm78jw/edit#).

Before web team syncs, teammates and stakeholders should write down under "Discussion items" in the meeting notes document anything that they'd like to bring up for discussion with the whole team.
