# Web team

[Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBsE9801DcBF9chZyMnxRdolqM_1c2pPyGQz15QAvYI/edit#heading=h.g2wq4qci7wj0)

## Vision statement

Bring the power of Sourcegraph (e.g. search, code intelligence, campaigns) to all developers everywhere that they interact with code (e.g. command line, editors, web browser, code hosts).

## Tech stack

TypeScript, React, RxJS, GraphQL, Go.

## Team syncs

The web team holds weekly syncs.

The meeting notes of web team syncs can be found [in this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1IUsjbtYdGiAHvRUB1yf4eqnynin9WsxFR2zFCMm78jw/edit#).

## Team sync preparation

Before web team syncs:

- Teammates should write down in the meeting notes document a brief status update stating what they have achieved since the last sync, and what they plan on working on next. Example:
  ```
  Loïc:
  - Last:
      - Reduced UI for GitLab integration
      - Bugs: hover overlay position, exceptions on MRs
  - Next:
      - https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/6520
  ```
- Teammates and stakeholders (such as the product manager or the VP of Engineering) should write down under "Discussion items" in the meeting notes document anything that they'd like to bring up for discussion with the whole team.
