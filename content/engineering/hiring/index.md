# Engineering hiring process

This section of the handbook documents the hiring process for roles on the engineering team.

Most of our process is documented in a private repository, but our goal is to move as much as possible into the handbook.

## Engineering managers

Our hiring process for engineering managers is somewhat ad hoc given our size and the roles that we are hiring for.

Here is a rough outline that we will be iterating on, and we can customize per candidate.

1. 45m VP Engineering intro call.
1. 60m CTO screen.
1. Interviews.

   - 1h [Team collaboration](https://github.com/sourcegraph/interviews/blob/master/engineering/team-collaboration.md).
     - [Christina Forney](../../../company/team/index.md#christina-forney-she-her) (required)
     - One engineer who this person would be managing.
   - 1h [Engineering leadership](engineering-leadership.md).
     - [Nick Snyder](../../../company/team/index.md#nick-snyder-he-him) (required)
     - Plus one of:
         - [Tomás Senart](../../../company/team/index.md#tomás-senart)
         - [Loïc Guychard](../../../company/team/index.md#loïc-guychard)
   - 1h [Technical experience](https://github.com/sourcegraph/interviews/blob/master/engineering/technical-experience.md)
     - Tomás Senart or Loïc Guychard (whoever isn't in the engineering leadership interview)
     - One engineer who this person would be managing.
   - 30m CEO

1. If we want to move forward, setup 30-minute calls to meet members of the team that this person will be managing. These calls are informal and no script.
