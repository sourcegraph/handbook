# Engineering hiring process

This section of the handbook documents the hiring process for roles on the engineering team.

Most of our process is documented in a private repository, but our goal is to move as much as possible into the handbook.

- [Private interview documentation](https://github.com/sourcegraph/interviews/tree/master/engineering/software-engineer).
