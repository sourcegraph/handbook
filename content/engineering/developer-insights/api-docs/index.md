# API docs workstream

For now API docs, is a workstream rather than a team.

It is part of a company-wide initiative called `Sourcegraph for public code`.
This company-wide initiative's mission is to help Sourcegraph become the standard tool for searching and understanding public code.

This workstream focuses on providing API docs for code repositories that are informative, interactive and indexable by web crawlers.
