# Roles on the Engineering team

This page lists the roles on our engineering team.

## Software Engineer

Software engineers build our product and infrastructure.

### Responsibilities

- Model and apply [our company values](../company/values.md) and our [guiding engineering principles](index.md#guiding-principles) throughout all your interactions and work.
- Iteratively create, ship, and maintain high quality architecture, code, tests, and documentation that aligns with team goals.
- Document and share your progress in relevant locations at least once a week (for example: in GitHub issues, team slack channel, #progress, [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)).
- Prioritize unblocking and supporting your teammates (for example: sharing knowledge, answering questions, providing feedback).
- Help build a great team by referring people who you would like to work with, interviewing candidates, and suggesting improvements to our hiring process.

## Engineering Manager

Engineering managers lead, grow, and develop teams of software engineers.

### Responsibilities

- Facilitate and sustain a healthy, inclusive team culture where everyone is set up to do their best work (examples: [retrospectives](../retrospectives/index.md), [team events](../people-ops/travel.md#team-events), [compensation](../people-ops/compensation/index.md)).
- Model, teach, and apply [our values](../company/values.md) and [our guiding engineering principles](../index.md#guiding-principles).
- Ensure the team has clear incremental goals that are documented and are always up-to-date (example: [PM – EM partnership responsibilities](../product/roles/product_manager_engineering_manager_responsibilities.md)).
- Regularly communicate the team's progress toward their goals as well as changes in team goals to appropriate stakeholders (examples: presenting a slide at [company meeting](../communication/company_meeting.md), [weekly updates](engineering-management.md#status-updates))
- Support and coach teammates to grow in their careers and fulfill their responsibilities (examples: [1-1s](../leadership/1-1.md), [retrospectives](), [review cycles](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/review-cycles/index.md), [compensation](../people-ops/compensation/index.md))
- Grow the team in a sustainable way so that the team can accomplish more over time (examples: define open roles, maintain a hiring plan over time, source candidates with help from our talent org, define efficient and effective interview process, make hiring decisions).

## Director of Engineering

Directors lead, grow, and develop multiple teams in Engineering.

### Responsibilities

- Lead, organize, and support the work of multiple engineering teams to deliver on key initiatives that are critical to the success of Sourcegraph.
- Recruit, hire, and grow excellent engineers and engineering managers to create a diverse team.
- Model, teach, and apply [our values](../company/values.md) in everyday interactions.
- Facilitate and sustain a healthy, inclusive team culture where everyone is set up to do their best work.

## VP Engineering

The VP of Engineering ensures that we have an effective engineering organization at Sourcegraph.

### Responsibilities

- Ensure that we have excellent people on our engineering team who are inspired and motivated.
- Ensure that we have the right plans/priorities, and we are delivering on those plans quickly/reliably.
- Ensure that we are making the right technical investments for the long term success of our product and team.
- Ensure that we have excellent culture, organization, and processes.

## Switching roles

Switching between an individual contributor role and a people management role (or vice versa) is a role change (not a promotion or a demotion). Each role requires a different set of skills. Generally we expect people managers to have experience doing the role of their direct reports. If you wish to change roles, start a conversation with your manager and they will help come up with a personalized plan that makes sense for you and the team's situation.
