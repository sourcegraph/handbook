## Permissive Licenses (ok to use)

You may use any code licensed under any permissive license, such as Apache, MIT, BSD. If you arenâ€™t sure whether a license is permissive, see the [permissive license list](https://blueoakcouncil.org/list) compiled by Blue Oak Council.

## Copyleft Licenses (not ok to use)

We avoid using code and libraries under copyleft licenses. If you can't find an alternative, reach out to the legal team. Below are the most common copyleft licenses:

- AGPL
- GPL (ok for internal use)
- LGPL (ok for internal use)
- CCDL (ok for internal use)
- Eclipse Public License (ok for internal use)
- Mozilla Public License (ok for internal use)
- Anything else not on the permissive license list

If it's for internal use only and not for distribution, then tell the legal team and the licenses marked with "ok for internal use" will likely be approved.
