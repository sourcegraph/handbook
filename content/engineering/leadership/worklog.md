### Engineering manager onboarding

- Problem: We recently hired and onboarded our first group of engineering managers and onboarded each of them in an ad hoc way. We will be hiring at least one more engineering manager in the near future (for the web team) and we want to document what we have learned so they have an even better onboarding experience.
- Owner: Nick
- Outcome: Documented our onboarding process for managers

### Career guidance for engineering roles at Sourcegraph

- Problem: It is not clear to engineers on our team how we think about career development at Sourcegraph.
- Owner: Chris
- Solution: Wrote [this blog post](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/software-engineer-career-paths/).

### Fullstack engineer role

- Problem: Cloud and Code Intelligence teams have a mix of frontend and backend work, but current workload is skewed toward the latter. It doesn't make sense to hire a single frontend dev because they would end up working alone and there might not be enough work to sustain a full time frontend dev.
- Owners: Tomás, Aida
- Solution: We defined a full stack engineer role.
