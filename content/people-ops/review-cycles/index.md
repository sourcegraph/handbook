## Why we do review cycles

The goal of these review cycles is to ensure that we’re providing every teammate the resources they need to continue to grow during their time at Sourcegraph, and review cycles offer a unique opportunity to give and receive valuable feedback from managers, direct reports, and peers. By having semiannual 360 reviews, we aim to give everyone the feedback necessary to help them progress in their career and meet their professional goals.

## Review cycle overview

We use [Lattice](https://lattice.com/) to conduct our 360 review cycles. It may prompt you to enter your goals. You are welcome to use this feature, but this should only be used for personal professional goals (as opposed to team or business goals, which are tracked in [our goals](../../../company/goals/index.md)). You and your manager should discuss what works best to track your individual goals.

The 360 review process entails writing your own self review along with giving feedback to your manager, and some of the peers you’ve worked closest with. You will also receive feedback from your manager, as well as your peers.

If you joined Sourcegraph within the last month, many of the questions in the review cycle wouldn't apply to you yet, so please answer those which you can, and write “N/A” where you can't.

Review cycles take place in March and September. They begin the first week of each of those months, and last for two weeks.

## 360 review cycle stages 
(All days exclude weekends)

### Peer selection (2 days)

**Managers:** (Day 1) You will be selecting peer reviewers for each of your direct reports via a spreadsheet that People Ops will create. (This is to ensure that all reviewers have a managable review load).

**People Ops:** (Day 2) Once all selections have been confirmed, People Ops will enter all peer selections in [Lattice](https://sourcegraph.latticehq.com/) and kick start the review cycle.

### 360 feedback (4 days)

**Everyone:** You will log into Lattice and on your dashboard you will be prompted to write three different types of reviews by answering the questions in the prompt.

- Self review: you will write a review of yourself.
- Manager review: you will write a review of your manager.
- Peer review(s): you will write reviews of the peers that your manager selected based off who you have worked with closely.

### Manager feedback + summaries (5 days)

**Managers:** You will be able to review all existing feedback for each of your direct reports and you will now be able to write your own review as well as an overall summary for each direct report. Once all of your reviews are submitted, you are ready to discuss and share the complete review packets with your direct reports during your one-on-ones.

Once the reviews are complete for each of your direct reports, you’ll be able to close out their review cycle individually in order to share their review packet with them during your next one-on-one. Here is a quick [“how-to” guide](https://help.lattice.com/en/articles/1712875-ending-a-direct-report-s-review-cycle-as-a-manager) on closing a direct report’s cycle as a manager.
