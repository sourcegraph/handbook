# Perks and benefits

We want our teammates to be happy, healthy, and productive. In order to best support that, we provide the following perks and benefits:

## Perks

### 🏡 All remote

We are an [all-remote team](../company/remote/index.md) so you have flexible work hours, work with the best people worldwide, and never waste time commuting. We give you a [budget to work from a coworking space and a budget to set up your home office](../finance/spending-company-money.md).

### 🏖️ Flexible PTO

We have a flexible Paid Time Off (PTO) policy with mandatory annual vacation time that encourages our team to recharge when they need to. Read more about our philosophy on [mandatory vacation time](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/why-vacation-at-tech-companies-should-be-mandatory-better-code-happier-people) and [PTO](./paid-time-off-and-working-hours.md).

### 🏃 Wellness

A healthy mind and body is imperative to doing your best work and living a healthy life. We offer an $100 monthly wellness stipend that can be used at your discretion.

### 👪 Family planning support

We value and support teammates at all stages of life. We provide 16 weeks of paid parental leave for all new parents (details depend on location), in addition to any pregnancy-related disability leave, and a reimbursement of up to $25,000 USD for fertility services (including but not limited to IVF, egg/sperm freezing, surrogacy, fertility hormone testing).

### 📚 Professional development

In addition to on-the-job training, we offer a $1,000 yearly stipend for educational opportunities (such as courses, extended education, books, conferences, etc.). We also hold detailed, twice annual 360 degree [Impact review cycles](impact-reviews.md) for all teammates.

### ✈️ Travel

We have generous [company, team, and individual travel budgets](travel.md) to encourage you to connect face to face with your teammates regularly.

### 🌐 Internet

Your paycheck automatically includes a fixed reimbursement for $50 of internet expenses monthly.

### 📱 Mobile phone

Your paycheck automatically includes a fixed reimbursement for $75 of mobile phone expenses monthly.

### 🎧 Desk set-up

We want to ensure all teammates have a workspace that will make them comfortable and productive, so we offer a $2,000 [desk set-up budget](../finance/spending-company-money.md#desk-set-up) for all full-time teammates to provide them with any necessary equipment to make that possible.

### 🏢 Co-working space

We offer our teammates a $300-500 [monthly budget](../finance/spending-company-money.md#recurring-expenses) to join a coworking space. Our intention is not for teammates to use this budget to rent set/permanent office spaces, but rather to have an alternative, flexible space from which to work if and when they may not be able to work from their homes productively. With the wide variety of coworking spaces and options available throughout the world, we ask that teammates stick to options within this budget, including all amenities and parking - teammates absorb any additonal cost for more expensive options, locations and/or amenities, such as private offices within coworking spaces, which are often not necessary. We also encourage teammates to consider coworking spaces where subscriptions include access to their spaces in various locations, particularly for teammates who enjoy travelling. If your circumstances are exceptional and require spend outside of this budget, feel free to reach out to the PeopleOps team.

### 🚚 Moving help

Whether you are relocating to join us or simply moving to a new place after you have already joined, we offer a yearly $1,000 stipend for hiring professional movers to reduce the stress associated with moving. Should you choose to move yourself, you may use this stipend for purchasing/renting moving boxes, packing materials, and if needed, a moving van/truck.
