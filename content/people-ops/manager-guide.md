# Manager accounts guide

As a manager you will have manager-specific permissions for several different accounts, which will allow you access to specific information about your direct reports in order to better support them. This page is intended to be a resource to help you navigate these different accounts and systems, which hold important and sensisitive information about your teams. In these systems you will find information on your teamâ€™s compensation, compensation bands, impact reviews, birthdays, PTO history, and more.

Should you have questions on any of these systems, you can post in #people-ops on Slack or reach out to the appropriate contact in our [People Ops Communications Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JItBWbfKV9lr-LAmE19I0JMvu3Cvh0AdrEHDv-r1E2w/edit#gid=0).

## BambooHR

[BambooHR](https://sourcegraph.bamboohr.com/login.php?r=%2Fhome%2F) is the source of truth for all teammate data and information. As a manager, your permissions allow you to view information and run reports on fields like start dates, compensation, titles, birthdays, and anniversaries for your direct reports and skip-level reports.

**Resources:**

 - **Running a pre-built report:** you have access to a pre-built "Manager starter report" that lists all of your direct reports by team and includes full names, pronouns, birthdays, hire date, compensation and more). You can reference this [short video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19mtcdTK0PgB-YOkODgda3ibLpzY3oyBw/view?usp=sharing) for a step by step walkthrough.

## Lattice

[Lattice](https://sourcegraph.latticehq.com/login?message=session) is the system we use for formal feedback such as:

* [Onboarding feedback milestones](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/onboarding/onboarding-feedback-milestones), which are used to track your new direct reports' onboarding progress on a monthly basis during their first three months. 
* [360 Impact reviews](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/impact-reviews), which are automatically launched every six months following a teammate's start date in order to complete a 360 impact review cycle.

Note: if you are a new manager and require access to past review history for your direct reports, please contact People Ops.

[Roots](https://www.tryroots.io/pto) is our paid time off (PTO) management system that is hosted within Slack. Roots allows all teammates to notify their manager and delegate any tasks during their PTO to appropriate teammates directly via Slack's interface. As a manager, you are able to pull reports on your team's historical and upcoming PTO.

## Assemble [WIP]
[Assemble](https://www.assemble.inc/) is the platform we use for storing compensation band information for every department and role we currently have. Assemble serves two main functions for managers:

* **Hiring:** it stores the compensation data of each level for the role(s) you are hiring for.
* **Leveling and calibration:** it's integrated with BambooHR, so you are able to view your direct reports compensation against our current bands. It visualizes the compensation band data to easily identify discrepancies and trends.
