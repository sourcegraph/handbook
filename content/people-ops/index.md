### How to reach the right member of the People Ops team

If you encounter a question at any point, we're here to help!

Our **[People Ops Communications Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JItBWbfKV9lr-LAmE19I0JMvu3Cvh0AdrEHDv-r1E2w/edit#gid=0)** will help you understand which aliases to use for your questions. It will also ensure you get the right attention, from the right team member, faster. In the spirit of transparency, for any questions which might apply to others, feel free to post in the Slack channels we listed in the matrix.

**U.S. based teammates** can contact our back office, Officengine, directly about questions pertaining to **health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, 401k, and payroll (including tax withholdings)**. To do this, use the [Sourcegraph support request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecCNJDd8r26WxjOK0AHIGEV1gfzN_tRdYnXr2heIejLN-BUg/viewform) form to input requests and indicate their urgency. This form feeds into Officengine's ticketing system and alerts their team via email. _Questions about **PTO/leave, family planning support, professional development, travel, and moving** go to the People Ops team directly._
