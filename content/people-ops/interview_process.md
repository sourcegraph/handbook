# Interview process

We document our [interview process](https://github.com/sourcegraph/interviews) for each role.

## Interviewers

For each interview we ideally want:

- At least one member from the team that the candidate will be joining.
- Two interviewers total, to maximize the number of interactions between the candidate and our team, and to continuously calibrate our interview process.

Interviewers may be adjusted due to scheduling difficulties (e.g. interviewer availability, timezones).

We want to mimimize the bias in our hiring process, so we will try to avoid scheduling you as an interviewer for candidates that you have an existing relationship with (e.g. close friends, family, significant others, candidate who you refer). This may be unavoidable if you are the hiring manager.

## Scheduling

We are flexible when it comes to scheduling interviews because we are all-remote and we don't need to schedule all interviews back-to-back (unlike typical onsite interviews at other companies).

- We try to schedule interviews as soon as possible given the availability of the candidate and our interviewers.
- We try to avoid more than 2 hours of consecutive interviews for a candidate.
- If interviews are spread over multiple days and it is clear from the initial feedback that we won't be moving forward, we will cancel the remaining scheduled interviews to save ourselves and the candidate time.

## Writing feedback

Please put your written feedback into Lever as soon as possible following the interview (immediately is ideal) while it is still fresh in your mind. To reduce bias and herding, please refrain from discussing your impressions with anyone else on the interview panel until everyone has submitted their written feedback.

Your feedback should contain two parts:

- Objective summary of the facts of the interview (questions and answers) in chronological order.
- Your subjective assessment of how well the candidate responded to your questions.

You can interleave these together, or leave the assessment for the end, whichever you prefer.

### Rating

- **Strong positive**. You are confident that this person would make our team better and you would be excited to have the chance to work with them.
- **Positive**. You observed only positive signs that this person would be a good fit for our team, but you don't feel strongly about hiring them.
- **Negative**. You are neutral or have doubts about whether this person would make our team better.
- **Strong negative**. You are very confident that we should not hire this person because they would not be successful on our team.

All positive feedback with no strongly positive feedback is usually not sufficient. We want to hire people who we are excited to work with.

## Debriefs

We conduct debriefs after a candidate finishes interviews. The debrief should be added to the calendar at the same time we invite the candidate to interviews.

### Canceling

Once interviews are over, the hiring manager may choose to cancel a debrief if the submitted feedback makes it obvious that we won't be moving forward with an offer AND if the outcome doesn't raise any questions from the hiring manager about the interview panels or hiring process (e.g., was there misalignment about the role the candidate was interviewing for, was there conflicting feedback worth discussing, could we have filtered out this candidate earlier in the process).  

### Format

The debrief calendar invite will include a link to a Google Doc that contains all the feedback (due to a limitation in Lever permissions). Everyone should pre-read all of the feedback before the debrief begins. The hiring manager drives the debrief discussion by asking specific questions that they prepared in advance (e.g, "I see you flagged a concern about X. Did reading feedback from other interviewers address your concern?").

### Outcome

| Sentiment                                | Outcome                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not enough excitement or serious doubts. | End interview process by not making an offer.                                                                                       |
| Interest in moving forward, but we are missing some signal. | Move forward with a followup call where the hiring manager asks direct and specific questions to gather the missing signal. |
| Sufficient excitement and no doubts.     | Move forward with an offer.                                                                                                         |

Candidate feedback will not be shared with anyone that didn't participate in the interview panel.
