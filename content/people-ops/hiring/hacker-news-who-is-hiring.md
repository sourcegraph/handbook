Sourcegraph code intelligence helps developers navigate and understand code by providing hover tooltips, go-to-definition, and find-references, when viewing code on Sourcegraph or on a code host (via our browser extension). Sourcegraph campaigns enable developers to fix and evolve code at scale by automating search-and-replace and running arbitrary tools across massive codebases.
