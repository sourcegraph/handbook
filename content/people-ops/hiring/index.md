# Hiring

## Values and practices

1. We want our hiring process to access all potential qualified candidates.
   - We proactively promote our open positions to many different groups, communities, and networks.
   - If we believe there is a talented set of individuals who are not applying to our team, we will initiate outbound efforts to reach them. We believe there is value in reaching out to candidates who are not directly connected to the social graph of our team today.
1. We want our hiring process to be fair to all candidates.
   - Our job descriptions use inclusive language.
   - We ask a consistent set of questions to each candidate so that we can objectively measure performance across candidates.
   - There are two interviewers in each interview so that we can better detect and compensate for misunderstandings during the interview and biases in the written feedback after the interview.
   - Interviewers take written notes during the interview so there is an objective record of the interview that can be referenced when making a hiring decision.
   - All interviewers submit written feedback independently before being able to see feedback from other interviewers. Feedback may not be edited after submission.
   - We maintain a consistent hiring [decision process](#decision-making-process) for all candidates.
1. Hiring managers own the hiring process for their team.
   - Hiring managers are encouraged to experiment to learn how to improve their hiring process.
   - The handbook is kept up-to-date with our learnings and current norms.

## How recruiting interfaces with hiring managers

For any members of a hiring team, please see [this page](how_recruiting_interfaces_with_hiring_managers.md) for a breakdown of each step in the hiring process.

The page will outline responsibilities by role (Hiring Manager, Scheduling Coordinator, and People Ops) for each team.

## Recruiting tools

We utilize LinkedIn as our sourcing platform.

Hiring managers will be a assigned a hiring manager seat on the platform. For details on hiring manager seat capabilities, [click here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/hiring/linkedin).

We will work with recruiters and hiring managers to gain access to the tools they need to be successfull.

## Job descriptions

Each job description lists qualifications (requirements) and nice-to-haves. If you are unsure if you meet our qualifications, please apply.

We prefer to avoid listing "years of experience" as a qualification because time is only an indirect measure of what we really care about: skills and maturity.

Our team contains highly motivated and productive members who've joined immediately after high school/university or after 10+ years of working at some of the best companies.

See the [job descriptions guidelines](./job_description_guidelines.md) when creating a new role.

## Decision making process

We review each candidate at each stage of our hiring pipeline (e.g. application, phone screen, interviews, references) to determine if we want to move the candidate to the next stage. Here are some things that we consider:

- Applications
  - Does this candidate meet all qualifications for the role they are applying for?
  - Does this candidate's resume and application effectively communicate their skills, accomplishments, and a genuine interest in Sourcegraph?
  - How do this candidate's skills, accomplishments, and interest in Sourcegraph compare to other candidates or our current team?
  - What makes this candidate's application stand out and excite us about moving forward with interviews?
- Interviews
  - Does this candidate have the skills and experience that we are looking for?
  - How do this candidate's skills, accomplishments, and interest in Sourcegraph compare to other candidates or our current team?
  - What makes us excited about hiring this candidate?

## Making a referral

Current employees can refer a candidate [here](https://hire.lever.co/referrals/new)

Having your referral complete the application provides helpful context when considering their profile, but is not required.

Benefits of having a referral complete the application:

- Provides information that the hiring team think is important for the role that may not have been represented in their resume or referral notes.
- Allows the hiring team to have a deeper conversation about who they are, what they are looking for, and about their experience.

## [Interview process](interview_process.md)

See [interview process](interview_process.md).
We perform reference checks for all new hires, see [reference check questions](reference_check_questions.md) for more details.

## Sharing interview feedback

We don't share specific reasons or feedback if we [decide](#decision-making-process) not to move forward in our hiring process with a candidate.

It would be nice if we could give feedback like this, but we don't do this today. Why?

- The written feedback that we collect during our interview process is intended for an internal audience. We don't ask our interviewers to spend time and effort packaging their feedback in a way that can be delivered directly to candidates.
- Adequately summarizing all interview feedback for a candidate is challenging and time consuming. We choose to spend our time focusing on delivering developmental feedback to our existing teammates.

If any interviewer is asked by a candidate for interview feedback, they may respond with the following message:

> I understand the desire to receive feedback from our interview process, but unfortunately we are not in a position to give it. Here is some public documentation to that effect: https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/hiring#sharing-interview-feedback.

## Respecting time

Interviewing requires time and effort, both for us and for candidates. The hiring manager is responsible for monitoring feedback during the interview phase, and if it becomes obvious that we won't be moving forward with a candidate, then the hiring manager should cancel any remaining interviews to be respectful of both the candidate's and interviewers' time.

## Sharing company financials

Choosing to join a company is a significant commitment. We want people to have an accurate view of Sourcegraph's financial and business position before they join. (Every Sourcegraph team member after they join has regular access to this information on our Google Drive, and they can ask the CEO directly if they have any other questions.)

> Hiring managers: If you're asked a question like this and you aren't 100% confident about the answer, please pass the question to the CEO or VP Business.

1. What is the company's latest valuation? (We share this when we give you the offer.)
1. What percentage of the company does my option grant represent? (We share this when we give you the offer.)
1. What is the total number of fully diluted shares? (You can calculate this from the number of options in your grant and the percentage that represents, but we're also happy to share this number.)
1. Other details about options. (These are covered in the employment paperwork you will receive.)

Here are some other questions that candidates have asked (e.g., in the [CEO interview](../../ceo/index.md#interviews-with-me)):

1. What is the current runway and the monthly burn rate?
1. How much cash does the company have in the bank?
1. Other [questions about Sourcegraph's internal financial metrics](../../ceo/index.md#questions-about-sourcegraph).

## Reference checks

[Reference checks](reference_check_questions.md).

## Making an offer

Once the decision is made to [extend an offer](interview_process.md#outcome) to a candidate, a representative from the People Ops team will reach out to the hiring manager to figure out offer details together.

When the offer is approved, the hiring manager and a representative from the People Ops team will schedule a call to walk through a summary of the offer with the candidate. This summary will include an overview of cash compensation (including any commission or bonus plans), benefits, and any equity-based compensation (including a simple calculator for potential future values).

Once the candidate verbally accepts the offer, Sourcegraph legal team will send the official DocuSign with the appropriate contracting or employment agreement(s) for the candidate's role, status, and location. Templates for employees and contractors can be found in the shared [HR/Employees/Contractors Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Legal/HR%3AEmployees%3AContractors).

## Policy for candidates re-applying to roles

Candidates are able to re-apply for roles at any time. The hiring team will review all relevant information, including past interviews, when considering a person's candidacy.
