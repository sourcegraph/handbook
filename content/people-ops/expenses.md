# Submitting expenses

## Invoices

For bills above $1,000, or for bills that require invoicing (versus using a personal credit card and expensing), please refer to the finance handbook's guide for [getting invoices paid](../ops/finance/payables.md#getting-invoices-paid).

## Submit expenses every month

Teammates should submit expenses at the end of every month, ideally in a single report for the full month.

Our accountants prepare unaudited financial statements every month based on the prior month's spending. Submitting expenses soon after the month ends simplifies their jobs, makes the financial reports we rely on for planning more accurate, helps @dan track and ensure that each teammate is in compliance with our monthly expense limits, and helps you get your money back faster!

Any expenses more than 90 days old require approval by People Ops.

## Contractors

Contractors should also submit expense reports promptly at the end of each month, and include the expenses in their [monthly invoices](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/invoices). Once the expenses are approved, the full invoice can be paid.

## Approvals

Generally, you should feel free to spend in ways that are in the best interest of the business (see our philosophy in [spending company money](spending-company-money.md)). However, if you intend to spend >$500 on a single purchase (or, depending on your position, above higher limits), please see our [spending limits](../ops/finance/payables.md#limits)

## Systems

We use Expensify for expense report submission and approval. You will receive an invitation to our Expensify organization during onboarding. When submitting an expense, please:

- Use the date of purchase (not the date of submission).
- Add a description of your expense in the designated field. 


### When submitting an expense via Expensify

- Please ensure that each expense is properly categorized. Some frequently asked questions about categories include:
  - Software purchases or subscriptions should be categorized as "Software and SaaS <$1000"
  - Computer purchases and other hardware (monitor, headphones, etc.) should be categorized as "Computer & Related" 
  - Home office set-up purchases (chairs, desks, etc.) should be categorized as "Furniture & Office"
  - Note: there is no designated "home office setup" category in Expensify. Each expensed item should be categorized individually. So even though we have one home office setup budget, it spans across multiple categories.
- Please ensure the date and description fields are properly filled out
  - The date listed on your expense should be the date of purchase (not the date of submission).
  - The description field should list exactly what item is being expensed.

### Internet, phone, and wellness benefits
- For US based teammates: these fringe benefits are automatically added to your paycheck (the total amount is split up over both paychecks for the month), there is no need to submit them via Expensify. 
- For teammates based outside the US: you can have have these as fixed line items on your invoices and you will be paid for the full amount every month.
- Fringe benefit amount (per month):
  - Internet: $50
  - Phone: $75
  - Wellness: $100
