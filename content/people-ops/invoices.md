# Submitting an invoice (teammates based outside of US)

## Monthly invoices

Any teammates based outside of the US are on a contracting structure and will need to submit an invoice once a month for payment. 

### Please follow the process below for submitting monthly invoices:

- All invoices should be sent via email to sourcegraph@officengine.com with noemi@sourcegraph.com copied on all emails.
- Include any expenses incurred that month as individual line items and attach all expense receipts to the same email with the invoice. 
- Include any fringe benefits on your invoice as individual line items as well (cell phone, internet, wellness benefits, etc.).
- Submit monthly invoices by the 2nd of the month so that payments can be issued by the 5th.

All invoices will be paid through [Veem](https://www.veem.com/).
