# Submitting an invoice (teammates based outside of US)

## Monthly invoices

Any teammates based outside of the US are on a contracting structure and will need to submit an invoice once a month for payment. 

### Please follow the process below for submitting monthly invoices:

- All invoices should be sent via email to sourcegraph@officengine.com with noemi@sourcegraph.com copied on all emails. (You do not need to submit an invoice via Veem.)
- Invoices should be submitted in USD, if expenses were purchased in another currency, please use this currency converter: https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/ and use the date of transaction. (Do not use the Veem currency converter.)
- Include any expenses incurred that month as individual line items and attach all expense receipts to the same email with the invoice. 
- Include any fringe benefits on your invoice as individual line items as well (cell phone, internet, wellness benefits, etc.).
- Submit monthly invoices by the 2nd of the month so that payments can be issued by the 5th.
- To calculate your monthly invoice, you can take your annual pay and devide it by 12 to arrive at the monthly amount.
- If it is your first month and you start later in the month, you will need to use the following formula to prorate that month:
  - Take your annual pay amount and divide it by 12 to determine your monthly pay.
  - Divide your monthly pay by 173.33 hours per month (average hours worked per month based on 40 hour weeks for 52 weeks, according to IRS).
  - Multiply by the number of hours you worked in the pay period. 
- Example: If you get paid $6000 per month and worked 5 days (40 hours): 6000 / 173.33 = 34.62 x 40 = $1384.8 

All invoices will be paid through [Veem](https://www.veem.com/). You should have received an invite to your personal email for a Veem account as part of onboarding.
