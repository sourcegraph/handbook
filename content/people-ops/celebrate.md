# Teammate Celebrations

Here at Sourcegraph, we like to celebrate, and we like to celebrate *you*! Use this guide to celebrate your teammates birthdays, anniversaries, and source some really great gift ideas.

  

## Anniversaries

We like to take the time to celebrate big milestones for teammates who have hit their yearly anniversaries (*and beyond*)! You can easily access all teammate anniversaries on our shared calendar called ***Sourcegraph Events*** or by checking your Bamboo HR homepage.

**Here are our best practices for celebrating your teammate’s anniversaries:**

-   People Ops to send a branded Sourcegraph gift to teammates on their anniversary each year

-   Managers to create a [Kudoboard](https://www.kudoboard.com/) for their teammate to gather signatures and well wishes in an email deliverable card. We have an annual subscription to Kudoboard. You can find our Sourcegraph credentials in 1Password under Kudoboard or by searching ‘*kudoboard*’ or ‘*birthday*’.
    
-   When creating the Kudoboard, the format should include:
    
	 - [ ] **Title**: Happy [insert number of year(s)] Anniversary, [first name of teammate]!
    
	 - [ ] **Delivery** **date**: set delivery of the Kudoboard to the day of their anniversary in the morning before work during their time zone. *(This is so they have something nice waiting in their inbox when they start work!)*
    

-   Manager to pass Kudoboard along to the following people:
    

	 - [ ] Immediate team members
      
	 - [ ] Anyone who teammate regularly works with

-   Teammates to [donate](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/donations) $100 USD to a 501c(3) organization of their choice. *(This tax code classification is typically listed on a non-profit organization’s webpage.)* Sourcegraph will double the amount and donate $200 USD in total to the organization. If you need any help finding an organization, reach out to *Cassie Melani*!
    

  
  

## Birthdays

Sourcegraph encourages team members to take a day of vacation on their special day in alignment with our [**Paid Time Off Policy**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nqkTF_e32wx_WMw5Y1a2C8iyh-iRtIcC9Mc54YwPSko/edit). If your celebration happens to fall over a weekend please be sure to take an alternate day such as the Friday prior or the Monday after.  
  
We’d also like to be considerate of all teammates and acknowledge that not everybody likes to be in the spotlight on their birthdays. Managers should check their employee’s BambooHR profile for their birthday and ask them personally if they’d like to celebrate it at work beforehand. With their permission, people managers will consult their team on an appropriate gift / gift card for the employee and can expense this using Expensify.

## Gift amount policy for birthdays

Birthday gifts should not exceed  **$50 USD** *per teammate*. It is also advisable to spend the same amount for each person on your team when getting a gift for them to create fairness within the group.

*Happy celebrating!*
