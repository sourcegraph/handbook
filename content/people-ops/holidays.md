# Holidays

We have a team that is based throughout many parts of the world and we respect everyone's local holidays. Therefore, there is no need for teammates to provide a specific enumeration of holidays by country, as holidays are explicitly covered as part of our unlimited PTO policy.

Teammates should add their respective holidays to the ["Not working" calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=c291cmNlZ3JhcGguY29tX2JiMGppMHY4OHFtbWw2bGJubW1iYTR2bzBvQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) as far in advance as possible in order to communicate to the team that they will be unavailable for those particular dates. Teammates should also notify both their teammates and manager, as an additonal reminder prior to the holiday.

We will reschedule any Monday [company meetings](../communication/company_meeting.md) to the next working day if it would otherwise fall on any of the following holidays:

* New Years Day - observed January 1st
* Martin Luther King Jr. Day - observed 3rd Monday in January
* Fourth of July - observed July 4th
* Christmas Eve and Christmas - observed December 24th and 25th

Also, there is no company meeting on or between December 23 and January 1. (Most team members will take that time off.)

On all other holidays (e.g., US Memorial Day), company meeting will be held normally, although we anticipate a higher-than-usual number of team members being unable to attend. (That is OK! Have a great holiday!)
