## For all new teammates

> NOTE: This list is incomplete because it includes only new steps added since the creation of the Sourcegraph handbook. Eventually all of the onboarding docs above will be migrated to this Sourcegraph handbook, then this list will be complete and this note can be removed.

- [ ] Add yourself to the [team page](../../../company/team/index.md).
- [ ] Watch the [new team member intro from the CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVHUGZe5uts)
- [ ] Set up a recurring weekly 25-minute [1-1 meeting](../../leadership/1-1.md) with your manager (e.g., `1-1 $YOURNAME-$MANAGERNAME`).
- [ ] If you are not familiar with Git, complete the [Git introduction](git_intro.md).
- [ ] Read the first page of [Sourcegraph's user documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/user).
- [ ] It might not be immediately necessary, but if you ever need to click a HubSpot link just ask for access in #sales.
- [ ] Go through the [analytics onboarding](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/projects/sourcegraph_events/files/1_home.md). This onboarding is within Looker, so if you don't have an account you can ask for access in #analytics. 
- [ ] [Add your working hours to Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings) so your teammates know when it is safe to add meetings to your calendar.
