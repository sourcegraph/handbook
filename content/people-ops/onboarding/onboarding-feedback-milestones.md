## Onboarding Feedback Milestones

The People Ops team wants to better support new teammates and managers by opening a two-way conversation between them throughout the [onboarding process](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/onboarding) about what’s on track and what needs action, both on the new teammates' contribution and how well they’re living our shared values.

Feedback check-ins are now part of the onboarding process, after each month of the onboarding period. We want teammates to feel comfortable during their 3 months onboarding by having formal feedback instances with their managers. 

This will help them understand their performance and how well they’ve been adapting to their new role. Teammates who understand what’s expected of them and can have conversations with their managers about how to improve are more likely to have a better experience. Managers should use these feedback milestones to guide the new teammate, reinforce good work practices, and better set them up for success. During these meetings, managers will help new teammates understand their role in the team and company and what’s expected of them.

In order for this to work, managers must define expectations, goals and responsibilities for each role before the new teammate starts. The new teammate must know about them and if any change at any point, they must be notified. This will set a guide for both the teammate and the manager on every meeting. If the expectations are not up to date, talk about them. (Do you think these changes are appropriate? Should this goal be modified?). Managers should go through the set goals, tasks, expectations set for the 30/60/90 days and provide positive feedback and talk about opportunities for growth

Following our [standards of success](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/onboarding#onboarding-standards-and-success), these conversations should take into consideration onboarding expectations, onboarding experience, and onboarding effectiveness.


### Purpose of each milestone

**Feedback Milestone: Month 1:**

- check in on onboarding, values fit and get a sense for how they’re feeling 
- normalise two-way feedback and 
- open conversation and build trust

**Feedback Milestone: Month 2 & 3:**

- check in on OKR tracking and values fit and get a sense for how they’re feeling
- normalise two-way feedback and 
- open conversation and build trust 
- get a feel for if they’re going to succeed and action if they aren’t (keep in mind teammates should be participating in projects by month 2 and owning projects by month 3)


### New teammate: Getting the meetings understood & scheduled

During the new teammates’ first week with us, they will find a task in their Process.St checklist called **Understanding your contribution**. This is what they’ll see:

**_OKRs_**

_In this section you’ll learn more about what goals & objectives we’re aiming to achieve in this quarter and this year (for Sourcegraph and your team), and get guidance on how to understand how you contribute to these and engage with your manager to get an idea of how you’re tracking._

_[Here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/goals/2021_q2) you can read about our Objectives and key results, and [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/goals/guidelines) you can read about why and how we define them._

_You should check[ this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pNXVev2JtYC94lB1NIfsc8OqyYnnSFn7p5PYFcniblE/edit#gid=1699297878) to read the OKRs for each team per quarter and see what your team is working on._

**_Feedback Milestones_**

_As part of our high-agency culture, we encourage you to own your career as much as possible - this includes asking for feedback on how you’re doing, and giving your manager feedback on what you need from them in order to succeed. You’ll chat to your manager a few times in your first weeks, but we’d like you to set up your first formal feedback milestones in your first three months with us._

_The aim of these meetings is to open a two-way conversation between you and your manager about what’s on track and what needs action, both on your contribution and how well you’re living our shared values._

_You must **set up three meetings** with your manager, each of them 30min long, using your Gmail calendar. Remember to include a Zoom call and name each of them as outlined below._

**_Feedback milestone 1: (your name)/(your manager’s name)_**

_Set this up for one month after your start date, and check our handbook for what to expect and how to prepare for this meeting._

**_Feedback milestone 2: (your name)/(your manager’s name)_**

_Set this up for two months after your start date, and check our handbook for what to expect and how to prepare for this meeting._

**_Feedback milestone 3: (your name)/(your manager’s name)_**

_Set this up for three months after your start date, and check our handbook for what to expect and how to prepare for this meeting._


### Managers: What to expect

To help facilitate these onboarding feedback milestones, we have developed check-ins in Lattice that will be active at the end of month 1, 2 and 3.  You will be given structured questions that serve as a guideline for you to have those important conversations pertinent to the onboarding process. The onboarding feedback milestones serve as a conversation guide and the answers serve as notes that you can reference to assess their onboarding success.

The question or topic notes will be private and new teammates will not see what managers have written and that’s why at the end you will be prompted to complete a summary of your conversation. This summary will be shared with the teammate.

**Manager prep**

- check onboarding checklist, 
- have list of values and examples ready, 
- have OKRs and examples ready,
- Think about the project in which the teammate is participating and their performance

**The conversation**

- _“We’re having this meeting so we can check in on how you’re tracking, both in your contribution and how you’re living the values. I’m going to ask some questions, but let’s keep this an informal conversation, feel free to speak up or ask questions at any time.”_
- Help me get a broad idea of how you’re doing
- Talk me through what’s on track with 1) your OKRs and 2) how well you think you’re living our values? THEN manager feedback with examples and impact.
- Talk me through what you think needs attention with 1) your OKRS and 2) how well you think you’re living our values? THEN manager feedback with examples and suggestions for development
- Are you clear on your individual OKRs and the team’s OKRs, and next steps to getting there? Is there anything that might prevent you getting there?
- What could I be doing 10% more of to help you succeed?
