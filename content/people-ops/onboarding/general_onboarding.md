### U.S. based teammates

### Teammates based outside of U.S.

- **[Veem](https://veem.com/)**: Submit monthly invoices.

## Configure Google Calendar

- [Add your working hours to Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings) so your teammates know when it is safe to add meetings to your calendar.
- Add any local [holidays](../holidays.md) you observe to your calendar so people know you're not working.
- Make it so any attendees can edit meetings you create: `Default guest permissions: Modify event` (this makes it easy for teammates to reschedule when necessary).
- Set up a recurring weekly [1-1 meeting](../../leadership/1-1.md) with your manager (e.g., `1-1 $YOURNAME-$MANAGERNAME`).
- Join the Sourcegraph events calendar by copying `sourcegraph.com_9cd67o8p3gs0rtpj73bt326psk@group.calendar.google.com` into your [add calendar field](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings/addcalendar?) 
- Also join the [social calendar](../../../company/remote/social_calendar.md)
- You can add a secondary time zone in your calendar. This will show two time columns. This is very useful when you work closely with people in another time zone. Go to **Settings > General > Time zone** and select the **Display secondary time zone** box. Choose the time zones you want and label them.

## Learn how to contribute to the handbook

- [Create an account on GitHub.com](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.
   - Share your username with your manager (if you're on the engineering team) or @noemi so they can add you to the Sourcegraph GitHub account and appropriate teams.
- If you are not familiar with Git, complete the [Git introduction](git_intro.md).
- Add yourself to the [team page](../../../company/team/index.md).
  - Add a link to your team page bio to your Slack profile
- Read Sourcegraph's [information security policy](https://about.sourcegraph.com/security) and acknowledge your acceptance: https://forms.gle/LUK1YtwAMJLhtRPi6.

## Learn about Sourcegraph

- Read the [Sourcegraph values](../../../company/values.md).
- Read the [Sourcegraph strategy](../../../company/strategy.md).
- Read the first page of [Sourcegraph's user documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/user).
- Go through the [analytics onboarding](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/projects/sourcegraph_events/files/1_home.md). This onboarding is within Looker, so if you don't have an account you can ask for access in #analytics.
