# Onboarding process for Hiring Managers

As the company grows, new hires are joining almost every week. The onboarding process the new hire goes through requires actions from both PeopleOps and the Hiring Manager. Some Hiring Managers are doing this for the first time and they don’t know what the process looks like, here they will find the necessary information.

## Before first day

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Once the teammate signs the contract, they will complete [this form asking for certain information we need to get them onboarded](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfW4N-YNAoGo5LW0bBs5AM_2xLlwmEEY650qxuQlSMVoM0rtQ/viewform?usp=sf_link):

- We confirm start date
- We ask for a selfie
- We ask for their phone number, for account setup

And GitHub username, if they have one.

About a week before the first day, the Hiring Manager needs to fill out [this Google Form with all the relevant tools, channels and groups the new hire needs to be added](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQjfoLjAZUim7pVYw9joQCssXuVz2t2RlpjLadzmHrj15cwQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to be able to start on day one. Also, here is where the Onboarding buddy is informed. **Please take the time to confirm with the buddy that they are willing and available before nominating them**.

Tech Ops will create their Sourcegraph email and add them to the basic onboarding tools:

- Slack
- Zoom
- 1password
- Greenhouse
- Lattice
- Process St.

</td>

PeopleOps will communicate in #teammate-announce all new teammates starting the following week, including their role and live email.

They will also be added to these calendar events: Meet the founders, New teammate happy hour, Meet & Greet - New cohort, and a check in with PeopleOps on their one month mark.

<tr>

Now that you have your new teammate's email you should:

- Create recurring 1:1 with new teammate
- Add new teammate to any team/role specific meetings and calls

You must also make sure to provide documentation and context on on going projects your team is working on.

Having this done before day one will make it easier for the new hire and an overall better experience.

The Friday before they start, we will send an email. Here they will have the login details to start on their first day, the link to their Process St checklist and useful information (Onboarding buddy program, the Monday’s company meeting where they will be introduced, we are handbook first, etc.).

</td>
<td>PeopleOps</td>
</tr>

## First day

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>You should notify new hires of any 1:1s they should have (any people on their team, or adjacent teams they will work closely with) so they can set them up.
   </td>
   <td>Hiring Manager</td>
  </tr>

## Checklist

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>PeopleOps and Hiring Manager will have certain tasks assigned to them on Process St. and they'll be able to follow the new hire’s progress in there, too.
   </td>
   <td>Hiring Manager & PeopleOs
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Checking the checklist before hand, will help keep in mind the content new hires will find there: the information they will be linked to, the tasks they have to complete and how much of the handbook they’ll cover.
   </td>
   <td>Hiring Manager</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Impact review cycles

<table>
<tr>
<td>

New teammates will go through their [Onboarding Feedback Milestones](./onboarding-feedback-milestones.md) on their first, second and third month with us. Please read the handbook page that walks you through what they are and why we find them valuable.

You will use Lattice to take notes during the Milestones. You will be notified via email and through the Slack integration when it's time for you to have them. As per their onboarding checklist, teammates are responsible to schedule the meetings for you both to have the conversation.

</td>

<tr>
<td>On the teammates 6 month mark, and every six months after that, manager and teammate will be part of the 360 Impact review cycle.</td>
