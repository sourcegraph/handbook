# Onboarding process for Hiring Managers

As the company grows, new hires are joining almost every week. The onboarding process the new hire goes through requires actions from both PeopleOps and the Hiring Manager. Some Hiring Managers are doing this for the first time and they don’t know what the process looks like, here they will find the necessary information. 


## Before first day


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>About ten days before the new hire starts (or as soon as they sign the contract, if they haven’t by that time) a Welcome email is sent to the new hire with the Hiring Manager in CC. Here we ask for certain information we need to get them onboarded:
<p>

   - We confirm start date
   - We confirm email preference
   - We send out information about purchasing the laptop
   - We ask for T-shirt size, for swag purposes, and address for shipping
   - We ask for a selfie
   - For US hires we inform about documentation needed for I-9 paperwork
   - We ask for their phone number, for account setup
<p>

   And GitHub username, if they have one.

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>About a week before the first day, the Hiring Manager needs to fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQjfoLjAZUim7pVYw9joQCssXuVz2t2RlpjLadzmHrj15cwQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Google Form</a> with all the relevant tools, channels and groups the new hire needs to be added to be able to start on day one. Also, here is where the preferred Onboarding buddy is suggested.

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The Thursday before they start, we create their Sourcegraph email. Once we have this we add them to:
<p>

   - Slack
   - Zoom
   - 1password
   - Lever
   - Lattice
   - Process St.
<p>
And create a Check in meeting for new hires with PeopleOps after their first month.
   </td>
   <td>PeopleOps
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>We will also let Hiring Managers know through the #people-ops channel in Slack that the email is live. Now you should:
<p>

   - Create recurring 1:1 with new teammate
   - Add new teammate to any team/role specific meetings and calls
<p>
Having this done before day one will make it easier for the new hire and an overall better experience.

  <tr>
   <td>PeopleOps will contact the suggested buddy and make sure they are available. Once they accept, we’ll create a weekly recurring meeting for both of them to meet for a month.
   </td>
   <td>PeopleOps
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>The Friday before they start, we will send an email. Here they will have the login details to start on their first day, the link to their Process St checklist and useful information (Onboarding buddy program, the Monday’s company meeting where they will be introduced, we are handbook first, etc.).

## First day


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>You should notify new hires of any 1:1s they should have (any people on their team, or adjacent teams they will work closely with) so they can set them up.
   </td>
   <td>Hiring Manager
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Once the new hire accepts their Lattice account, we will link them to their manager. Also, once they’ve accepted their 1password account, we’ll give them access and share the Shared vault with them.
   </td>
   <td>PeopleOps
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## Checklist


<table>
  <tr>
   <td>PeopleOps and Hiring Manager will be able to follow the new hire’s progress on Process St. Also, they’ve got certain tasks assigned to them, too.
   </td>
   <td>Hiring Manager & PeopleOs
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Checking the checklist before hand, will help keep in mind the content they will find there: the information they will be linked to, the tasks they have to complete and how much of the handbook they’ll cover.
   </td>
   <td>Hiring Manager
   </td>
