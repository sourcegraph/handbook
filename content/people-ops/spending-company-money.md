# Spending company money

We want to make sure you have what you need to be productive and happy in your role at Sourcegraph, so we've come up with a few guidelines to help you when you have work-related expenses. Below you'll find a list of some typical purchases that you would be reimbursed for, as well as a few things to keep in mind when expensing purchases:

- You are free to purchase these items and expense them without asking permission as long as it's in the interest of the company. When in doubt, please contact @sourcegraph/people-ops for clarification before the purchase.
- You likely won't need every single item on this list—please use your best judgment and buy when you need them. Remember, Sourcegraph doesn't have unlimited funds—spend this money as if it was your own.
  - For example, if you intend to work out of a coworking space most of the time, you may not need a fully equipped home office as well.
- If you spend more than $1,000 on any given physical item, it will be considered property of the company.
- Please file an expense report within 60 days of an eligible purchase. See [submitting expenses](expenses.md) for additional help.

## Desk set-up

### Full-time teammates

We expect new teammates to spend up to **$1,850** for desk setup, which includes all the items in the "Desk items" section. 

This is not a hard budget—rather, it is a guide based on what past teammates have spent. As a reminder, you don't need permission for every purchase, and we trust you to make decisions that are in the best interests of Sourcegraph. If you expect to significantly exceed the listed amount on any purchase, however, please notify @sourcegraph/people-ops so we can decide if we need to update this guide.

#### Team-specific totals

- We expect new [Design team](../product/design/index.md) members to spend **$2,650** to allow for purchasing higher-resolution monitors or other design equipment.
- Since they are customer-facing and need to deliver high-quality demos and support, [Customer Engineering](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/ce) team members can exceed these limits (within reason) to allow for purchasing beefier-spec computers, additional monitors, mics, lighting, etc.

### Interns

The estimated spend for interns is **$925*** and includes only the electronic items in the "Desk set-up" section.

### Desk items

- Monitor
- Headphones
- Keyboard
- Mouse or trackpad
- USB-C Adapter
- HDMI/monitor cable
- Laptop stand
- Desk
- Ergonomic chair
- Camera (for people who present externally to clients and prospects)

Once your contract is signed, you will need to purchase and expense your Sourcegraph computer. Computers and laptop insurance (this includes Apple Care if you purchase a Mac as your work computer) are fully reimbursable outside of the [desk setup total estimate above](#desk-set-up), however, engineering roles have different hardware requirements from other roles (please see below for necessary specs corresponding to your role). Computers are considered property of the company.
