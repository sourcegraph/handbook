# Booking travel through TripActions

## Flights

All Company-sponsored flights will be booked through TripActions. The costs will be added to a Sourcegraph invoice, and no credit card is needed. While it is possible to find a cheaper flight outside of TripActions, we get overall better rates in the aggregate with the buying power of the whole company.

## Hotel Accomodations

All Company-sponsored hotels & lodging (with the exception of Company-wide meetups) will be booked through TripActions. The costs will be added to a Sourcegraph invoice, and no credit card is needed. Please note that in addition to hotels, you can also book Airbnb stays via TripActions.

## Modes of Transportation

All Company-sponsored car rentals will be booked through TripActions. The costs will be added to a Sourcegraph invoice, and no credit card is needed. Please note that in addition to car rentals, you can also book trains and rideshare trips (i.e. Uber/Lyft) via TripActions.

## Personal Bookings

In TripActions, you can book personal travel. This benefit allows for teammates to have streamlined travel arrangements with business-preferred rates and 24/7 travel agent service. Note that when selecting this option, a personal credit card will be required at the time of booking. Personal trips cannot be added to the Sourcegraph invoice.

## How to book

- Once you login, the TripActions dashboard provides the option to start a booking directly. The possibilities are to book flights, hotels, trains, or rental cars.
- Input information for the flight you want to book. You can pick return as a combination or each leg of your flight separately.
- Select "continue to checkout" and fill out the reasons for booking.
- Once confirming all details are correct, you can select "complete booking." If your trip is out of policy, you will have the ability to continue booking the trip and a "soft" approval email will be sent to your direct manager.
- You can add a hotel or car by clicking the boxes between the flight details and "complete booking" and go through the same steps.

## Booking shows Out of Policy

If you receive an out-of-policy notification upon booking, an email will be sent to your direct manager for approval.
We understand that there may be a time when there is no way around booking a flight or hotel that is out of policy. Please provide detail to make approval easier and faster.
After 24 hours without any manual action (approved/denied), the booking will automatically be accepted.
Please note all out-of-policy related questions can be sent to travel@sourcegraph.com and #expense-inquiries in Slack.

## Do I need to use TripActions for booking my travel?

Moving forward, TripActions will be our source of truth for booking travel. All teammate travel must be booked through this platform to be considered within your travel budgets. Any travel booked outside of TripActions unfortunately will not be reimbursed.

Our shift to this platform is for ease of tracking budgets both for teammates on an individual level, and for managers on a team level. We are also able to use this platform to track the locations of teammates as they travel throughout the world so we can monitor their safety and the changing conditions of Covid-19 through their tool [_Sherpa_](https://tripactions.com/blog/tripactions-introduces-sherpa-integration-for-safer-travels).
