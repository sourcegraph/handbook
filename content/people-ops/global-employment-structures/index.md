# Ways we engage talent outside of the US
Being an all-remote company without entities outside of the US yet, we adopt different ways of engaging talent across the world. Here we outline the different ways we do this outside of the US, and the considerations and limitations associated with each type, for hiring managers and referring teammates to be aware of.

## Employees of Sourcegraph subsidiaries (once available)
We are working on forming international subsidiaries. Once we form them, we will hire certain teammates outside the US as employees of Sourcegraph subsidiaries.

### Contracts
Sourcegraph subsidiary employees will sign an employment agreement with the Sourcegraph subsidiary as required by local employment laws.

### Benefits
Sourcegraph subsidiary employees will receive employee benefits in accordance with our handbook and local employment laws.

### Payments
The Sourcegraph subsidiary will pay these employees directly in the local currency. 

### Onboarding
Sourcegraph subsidiary employees go through team-specific onboarding.

## Employees of PEOs/EORs (if available)
In countries where we don’t have a subsidiary, we will see if a third-party PEO or EOR (such as Remote.com) is available to provide employer-of-record services to employ a teammate outside the US as a PEO employee. 

Currently, we use PEOs in the following countries:  the UK and the Netherlands. We will provide updates as we adopt PEOs for more countries.

The Talent team and hiring managers carefully assess these exceptional cases where a PEO/EOR may be required, and engage the PeopleOps team to chat about the merit of the case early on, as our current partner, Remote, may not be able to support us in all countries.

### Contracts
Teammates who are employed via Employer of Record (EOR) or Professional Employment Organization (PEO) will receive an employment agreement directly from the EOR/PEO (our current preferred partner is Remote). The EOR/PEO will act as the direct employer as they are incorporated in the particular country where we are hiring the teammate.

### Benefits, allowances and expenses
PEO employees will receive employee benefits in accordance with our handbook and local employment laws. 

### Payments
The PEO will pay these employees directly in the local currency in accordance with local employment laws.

### Onboarding
Employees via PEO/EOR are marked as hired in Greenhouse, have a start date that aligns with the cohort calendar, have a profile in Bamboo, and enjoy the same thorough general or team-specific onboarding enjoyed by regular teammates. 

## Contractors (where neither of the above options are viable)
We engage contractors for certain projects on an as-needed basis. Such contractors use their own systems and tools. They have limited access to Sourcegraph systems. 

We also engage teammates outside the US as contractors where no Sourcegraph subsidiary or PEO is in place. If appropriate, Sourcegraph may convert these contractors to employees of Sourcegraph subsidiaries or PEOs once available or after a certain period of time. 

### Contracts
Contractors sign consulting agreements with Sourcegraph. The agreement depends on the contractor’s country of residence, length and type of engagement, and whether the contractor signs as an individual or on behalf of an entity. Some contractors choose to bill their services through an entity for various reasons, such as tax benefits. 

### Benefits
Contractors are not eligible for employee benefits such as healthcare. However, contractors may expense certain costs incurred in performing their duties. 

Full-time, indefinite term contractors receive the same compensation as full-time US teammates, regardless of the contractor’s location. We want to give teammates the flexibility to work from anywhere in the world, and contracting is the only structure that fully allows us to offer that. We have kept all offers and roles on a US salary rather than adjusting for cost of living by location. The intention is that this difference would allow teammates to cover the benefits we are unable to provide on a contracting structure. Full-time contracting teammates can expense recurring expenses as outlined in our handbook.

### Payments
Contractors submit an invoice at the end of each month in Veem or Bill.com, including any reimbursable expenses. 

### Onboarding
Contractors generally don’t go through team-specific onboarding, except for full-time, indefinite term contractors or where the hiring manager flags an exception to the Talent and PeopleOps teams. 

## Temporary Contractors
As we’re building a company for the long-term, we rarely take on temporary contractors in any country (including the US) unless under exceptional circumstances, like once-off projects or to cover for an existing teammate who will be away for a short period of time.  Temporary contractors are independent contractors who supply work or services to us on an “as needed” basis, use their own systems and tools to do so, and invoice us monthly for the work they’ve done. While we strive to make them feel welcome and support their success in their short time with us, they are not considered teammates, and some of their access to our systems, meetings and benefits may be limited. 

### Contracts
Temporary contractors receive a generic temporary contract that specifies a contracting fee, a start date and an expiry date, and dates are only extended if agreed in writing, no more than one (1) month before the contract expires. 

### Benefits, allowances and expenses
Due to their classification as temporary contractors, they are not eligible for benefits and allowances as per our handbook, and we are unable to reimburse any expenses related to these. Costs incurred in performing the duties of the role may be considered. 

### Payments
Temporary contractors are paid via invoice on a monthly basis, in their local currency, through Veem or Bill.com. They are required to submit an invoice at the end of each month with the work completed as agreed in their temporary contractor agreement. 

### Onboarding
Temporary contractors are marked as hired in Greenhouse, have a start date that aligns with the cohort calendar, and have a temporary profile in Bamboo, but typically they do not gain access to the thorough general or team-specific onboarding enjoyed by regular teammates. Their onboarding usually includes a welcome email with information for their first day, and the onboarding checklist and resources, but excludes activities like being introduced in the company meeting, meet & greets, lunch & learns, buddies and feedback milestones. Access to Slack is also limited to “multi-channel guests” and specific channels requested by the hiring manager. 

Hiring managers should consult the Talent and PeopleOps team early if an exceptional situation requires a different onboarding process for reasons critical to the role, or if the role is expected to become a full-time role in the near future. Alternatively, it’s up to hiring managers to set up introductions and provide information as needed for the purpose of the temporary contract.

## Work Visas
Since our teammates can generally work from anywhere in the world, we sponsor visas for only roles that require the presence in a particular country as part of the job responsibilities. In such cases we will work to support teammates as much as possible, but if our PEOs do not sponsor the visa, an alternative solution may take multiple months to implement. We encourage hiring managers to let the Talent and PeopleOps teams know as early as possible, before the role is even opened, if such requirements exist.

For candidates currently on a visa who prefer to keep their status in a particular country for personal reasons, Sourcegraph may be able to sponsor the visa depending on our PEO’s ability to support the specific visa. See the full list of countries in which we currently offer PEO-based employment at <LINK>.). We may require the candidate to carry the cost of transferring the visa to the PEO.
