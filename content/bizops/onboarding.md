# BizOps onboarding

Welcome! We're so excited to have you join the BizOps team. This document outlines the structure of your first few weeks at Sourcegraph.

## Week 1

### Get set up

You'll have to get some basics set up in your first few days:

- Complete the [Process St onboarding](https://app.process.st/reports/).

### Understand company and team mission, values and goals

- [Sourcegraph values](../company/values.md)
- [Sourcegraph strategy](../company/strategy/index.md)
- [Sourcegraph OKRs](../company/goals/index.md)
- [Current BizOps projects](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/63)

### Understand Sourcegraph communication and documentation standards

- We're a handbook-first company. Learn all about the handbook on its [handbook page](../handbook/index.md).
- Join relevant Slack channels. The main channels are [listed in the handbook](../communication/team_chat.md#channels), but it's a good idea to look through all the channels in our Slack and join all that seem relevant! The channels that BizOps uses most heavily are #business-ops and #analytics, in addition to the channels of teams we work with.
- Learn about how we work. We're an all-remote company, which means [we work asynchronously as much as possible](../company/remote/index.md#all-remote) and a lot of decision making happens through [RFCs](../communication/rfcs/index.md).

### Onboarding sessions

Your manager will help you schedule the following training sessions:

- Product demo
  - Cloud vs. self-hosted
  - Search (including code monitoring)
  - Code intel (including the difference between search and precise)
  - Sourcegraph and browser extensions
  - Batch Changes
  - Code insights
- Review the [sales onboarding quiz](../sales/onboarding/quiz.md)
- Check out the [Dev Pain Sessions](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/167Umyjs25fHPonju2ctWhtrkADDQ1WSJ) in the Know Thy Dev sales enablement program for a deep dive into how Sourcegraph solves common developer pains. These videos are long so I recommend skipping to the parts the CEs are demoing and listening at at >1x speed
- Product analytics overview
  - Event logger and pings overview
  - On-prem deployment to Google BigQuery to Looker data flow
- Sales and marketing data overview (focused on the data instead of the tools)
- GitHub and git walk-through (Q&A)
  - Read through the [git intro](../people-ops/onboarding/git_intro.md) and [add yourself](../people-ops/onboarding/general_onboarding.md#learn-how-to-contribute-to-the-handbook) to the team page

### Get to know fellow teammates

- Schedule 1:1s with teammates to start getting to know who you'll be working with! Ask your manager for a list of people you could get started with! The [org chart](../company/team/org_chart.md) is also good place to start.
- Begin joining relevant weekly team meetings wherever possible. For example, if you will be working closely with our commercial teams (e.g. Sales, Marketing, Customer Engineering), join our weekly Customer Ops sync, the company pipeline review, and more. Your manager will help you identify and get invites to the right list of meetings.

## Weeks 2 and 3

- Your manager and you will work together to find good onboarding projects that combine your areas of interest with real problems we need to solve. These projects should include the following elements:
  - Familiarize you with our tech stack (HubSpot/Salesforce for customer ops roles and BigQuery/Looker for product ops roles)
  - Reinforce our product's value propositions
  - Include collaboration with another team to start building familiarity with how other teams operate
  - Be opportunities for you to get a quick win or two
- Continue asking questions about Sourcegraph (the company and product) and reinforcing our values and goals.
- Look back at your onboarding material from week 1. It's a lot of new information, but it will become second nature over time with a little bit of repetition!
- Think about how onboarding could be improved for the next person and make changes to it along the way. It will never be perfect, but it can always get better!

## Week 4

- Get onboarded onto your first big project!
