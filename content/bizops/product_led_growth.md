# Product-led growth at Sourcegraph

## What is product-led growth (PLG)?

Product-led growth (PLG) is an end user-focused growth model that relies on the product itself as the primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion.

You’ve likely been a part of many companies’ PLG strategy. This is most evident if you’ve used the free tier and then later paid for any of the following products:
- Figma
- Slack
- Dropbox
- Twilio
- Datadog
- Airtable

## How does product-led growth fit in with our focus on revenue?

With MAUs being removed as a top-level goal, nothing changes for product-led growth at Sourcegraph in the long run. We still need to build the PLG flywheel, but instead of focusing on generating the highest number of users possible we will now:
- Shift focus towards high quality users (those who are likely to convert to revenue)
- Improve our design and messaging towards properly educating users on the problems Sourcegraph solves and the value it provides to them (orient around use cases), and guide them to the deployment option that is right for them
- Continue to build out virality and monetization capabilities (Cloud SaaS team)
- Continue to improve on the complete user experience through product enhancements, onboarding, email marketing, etc on both self-hosted and cloud
