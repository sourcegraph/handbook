# Vision, Strategy, and Roadmap Template

> ℹ️  The following is a template for use on the pages of specific product & engineering teams, used to record and share the vision, strategy, and roadmap.<br>Copy to your team's page and complete accordingly. Other sources of truth (such as Q3 one-pagers, existing goals pages) should have their content integrated here and then be marked as deprecated. Be sure to also replace instances of `ProductArea` with your actual product area name. Unless otherwise specified, each section should be a paragraph or two but you're welcome to use your own judgement if you think a deeper dive is appropriate.

> As you write this document, keep in mind that focusing on problems to solve more than lists of features tends to be a better way to approach communicating with people interested in your product area (customers, sales, analysts, etc.) as it leaves room for learning between what you know now and what you deliver in the end. This is not to say you never talk about features, but especially as you get [further out in planning](https://medium.com/@jobv/the-nearsighted-roadmap-57fa57b5906a) the blend of features vs. problems to solve should move more towards the latter.

> Be sure also to explain [why something is part of your direction](https://medium.com/leadership-motivation-and-impact/the-power-of-starting-with-why-f8e491392ef8). What you are doing is interesting, but why you have chosen that of all the possibilities is often even more enlightening.

# Handbook Direction

Sourcegraph is a Handbook first company. The Handbook is our source of truth, and a living document and we expect every teammate to propose improvements, changes, additions, and fixes to keep it continuously up-to-date and functional.
This page outlines the vision, strategy, and goals of the Handbook team.

## Mission, Vision & Guiding Principles

### Mission

What is the team's reason for existing? What is the fundamental value they aim to provide? Who are your key customers/stakeholders and why, and are there any customers/stakeholders that you're explicitly choosing not to address that people might have expected you to?

### Vision

#### 1 Year vision

> Add a sentence or two here indicating what the most important things you want to achieve/problems you want to solve in the next year are. These should in most cases move your three and ten year visions forward.

#### 3 Year vision

> Add a sentence or two here describing what your product will be like in three years, also focusing on the problems you'll solve and the value you'll deliver. This should be grounded in reality, but three years is a lot of time - be ambitious!

#### 10 year vision

> A sentence or two on your ten year vision is where you can really go wild and describe the problems you want to solve and solutions you want to deliver unbound by limitations of technology or scope. Be inspiring and look to the our [10 and 30 year strategies](../../company/strategy.md#sourcegraph-strategy) for ideas.

### Guiding principles

- **The Handbook can ve viewed by anyone.** One of our Sourcegraph values is [transparency](../../company/values#open-and-transparent.md). We want all public information to be available to everyone, whether they work at Sourcegraph or not, and it all lives in the Handbook. The Handbook should be searchable and easy to navigate.
- **The Handbook can be edited by any Sourcegraph teammate.** We value [high agency](../../company/values/high-agency.md) and encourage all teammates to update the Handbook as they see fit. We provide resources to help teammates contribute to the Handbook no matter their technical background.
- **The Handbook is maintained by every Sourcegraph teammate.** At Sourcegraph, [we work as a team](../../company/values#work-as-a-team.md). No one person is responsible for keeping our content updated, it falls on all of us. Editing and updating pages should be quick and well documented.
- **The Handbook is a source of truth** at Sourcegraph, and information there is expected to be accurate and up-to-date.

Describe the target by which we prioritize:

- Market or audience
- [Personas](../../marketing/personas.md)
- Jobs or Use Cases
- Industries
- What matters to us when we prioritize products and features
- Contextual things that matter to Sourcegraph or the product

## Where we are now

- What did we achieve in the last few months?
- What key learnings did we recently make?
- What is on the critical path for growth?
- How does the product fit within Sourcegraph as a whole?

### Top customer, support, sales and marketing issues

- What are the top issues customers are facing? (All, you can call out ones we're tackling (or not) in the Strategy & Plans section)
- What are the top requests from other teams at Sourcegraph? (All, you can call out ones we're tackling (or not) in the Strategy & Plans section)

### Competitive landscape

### What's next and why

More detailed plans related back to the themes and goals. If your time frame covers more than a quarter, it would be valuable to give some indication of time within the plans in this section, to help others appreciate the likely ETA of value.

### What we're not working on & why

What are we explicitly not working on? Are there frequent requests from customers or other teams we are choosing not to take on? Making that explicit makes other teams understand the strategy and reduces back and forth.

If there is a time component (e.g. "We're not working on this this Q but likely to pick it up next Q"), call it out.
