## Mission, Vision & Guiding Principles

### Mission

The Handbook serves as a [source of truth](../../communication/sources-of-truth.md) for company policies, team process, strategy and more. We live our value of [being open and transparent](../../company/values#open-and-transparent.md) by keeping the Handbook public.

**We help Sourcegraph teammates** find and document information quickly by providing a smooth navigation experience and an accessible contribution process. An easy-to-use Handbook is essential for teammates to be efficient in their daily work and engaging with customers.

**We help Sourcegraph candidates** learn more about the company during their application and interview process by keeping our Handbook public.

**We help Sourcegraph current and potential customers** learn more about the company they're working with by publishing and maintaining [public](../../company/values#open-and-transparent.md) documentation.

### Vision

#### 1 Year vision

> The Handbook is every Sourcegraph teammate's go-to source for answering their questions, and the team is enabled to create and maintain content as they see fit.

#### 3 Year vision

> The Handbook is not only a resource for answering sprcific questions, but also for browsing to learn about what's going on at Sourcegraph. Interactive content provides tailored onboarding and learning experiences to be used during the full span of one's career at Sourcegraph. It's a visually pleasing and functional artifact of the current state of the company and team.

#### 10 year vision

> The Sourcegraph Handbook is an industry standard for documentation, and has inspired other companies to embrace a culture of high agency and transparency with a tool like this.

### Guiding principles

- **The Handbook can ve viewed by anyone.** One of our Sourcegraph values is [transparency](../../company/values#open-and-transparent.md). We want all public information to be available to everyone, whether they work at Sourcegraph or not, and it all lives in the Handbook. The Handbook should be searchable and easy to navigate.
- **The Handbook can be edited by any Sourcegraph teammate.** We value [high agency](../../company/values/high-agency.md) and encourage all teammates to update the Handbook as they see fit. We provide resources to help teammates contribute to the Handbook no matter their technical background.
- **The Handbook is maintained by every Sourcegraph teammate.** At Sourcegraph, [we work as a team](../../company/values#work-as-a-team.md). No one person is responsible for keeping our content updated, it falls on all of us. Editing and updating pages should be quick and well documented.
- **The Handbook is a source of truth** at Sourcegraph, and information there is expected to be accurate and up-to-date.

### What's next and why

More detailed plans related back to the themes and goals. If your time frame covers more than a quarter, it would be valuable to give some indication of time within the plans in this section, to help others appreciate the likely ETA of value.

### What we're not working on & why

What are we explicitly not working on? Are there frequent requests from customers or other teams we are choosing not to take on? Making that explicit makes other teams understand the strategy and reduces back and forth.

If there is a time component (e.g. "We're not working on this this Q but likely to pick it up next Q"), call it out.
