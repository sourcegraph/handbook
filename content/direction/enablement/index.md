# Enablement direction

The Enablement organization comprises teams working on the technical foundations for developing our product. This page describes the overarching mission and strategy that ties these teams together. Each team has an individual direction page that describes what they are working on and why in more detail. Our direction home page details our directions as well as indexes individual team direction pages.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide the right technical foundations critical to the success of our customers and product development. We do this by ensuring we have the best tools, processes, and services in place, for use by both customers and our own engineers.

## Vision

### One year vision

> Remove friction in the install and upgrade process so that customers and prospects have a positive first experience with our product. Our development environment at Sourcegraph enables our team members to solve the most critical problems for our enterprise users. Enable site admins easily configure sourcegraph so that our install base grows.

### Three year vision

> A frictionless development and deployment environment.

### Ten year vision

> Sourcegraph is a thought leader in how to deliver product on-premises and to the cloud with common product experience regardless of deployment solution. Our internal development systems & practices are sought after by other companies as well as individual talent.

## Focus Areas

We are focused on several themes to help make our one year vision a reality. They are not listed in priority order, as we are pursuing all of them. To see how these play into what any particular product area is delivering, take a look at the individual team direction pages, as indexed on our [direction home page](../index.md#enablement)

### Make it easier to contribute to our frontend codebase

Developing a component system leads to a consistent user experience, faster delivery, and more inclusive design. To ensure better adoption and customer satisfaction with our product we are also focused on improving page rendering performance and perceived performance when a user interacts with the application.

### Reduce friction in deployment and upgrade

Enable Sourcegraph customers and prospects to easily access the value our product provides without tripping over blocks in the install & upgrade process. Ensure Sourcegraph can be run by any user with a standard engineering background at scale and with ease. Set clear expectations with customers / prospects on the environment requirements necessary to manage Sourcegraph at the scale they seek.

### Delight our site admins

Site admin’s are a critical part of our success. We want to ensure configuring sourcegraph is intuitive and does not create unnecessary burden in their process.

### Expand support of code management systems

As we broaden our reach, prospects and customers look to us to support a large variety of code management systems. We want to provide our user base the means to simply, easily, and reliably connect to all common code management systems.
