# Code Graph

Code Graph comprises teams working on [Search](./search/index.md), [Code Insights](./code-insights/index.md), [Code Intelligence](./code-intelligence/index.md), and [Batch Changes](./batch-changes/index.md). This page describes the overarching mission and strategy that ties them together, and each linked team also provides a detailed direction page with where they are headed next and why. There is also a whole-company [Sourcegraph direction](../index.md) available.

## Mission

We build the Code Graph to make working with code easier, regardless of how much you have, how complex it is, where you store it, or even how technical you are.

## Vision

### One year vision

> We want to ensure that we are solving the most critical problems for our enterprise users, focusing on retaining existing and acquiring new enterprise customers. By providing as much value as possible to them, we can grow the business while solving the hardest scaling and complexity problems for everyone.

### Three year vision

> We imagine a much more connected Code Graph experience, not just in terms of the kinds of searching that you're able to do, but in how we can offer suggestions for interesting searches and what you can do with the results. Expanding on capabilities we've introduced recently, such as semantic search, insights, and batch changes, we will offer an unparalleled solution for searching and making decisions across branches, repositories, and even code hosts, beyond even what's possible today.

### Ten year vision

> We want to make using Sourcegraph to understand and modify code so easy that anyone can do it, including people not traditionally considered developers. We want to [democratize coding](../../company/strategy.md#10-year-vision) by making it so that everyone in the company can engage with the organization's code, safely making changes to implement their department's priorities and interests, without need for an intermediary to do it for them.

## Focus Areas

We are focused on several themes to help make our one year vision a reality. They are not listed in priority order, as we are pursuing all of them. To see how these play into what any particular product area is delivering, take a look at the individual team direction pages linked at the [top of this page](#code-graph).

### Make the power of the Code Graph easier to find and use

Learning what's possible and how to get the most out of Code Graph tends to be trial and error, especially for an individual developer who might have a unique set of use cases and interests for which they would benefit from exploring. Making onboarding and interaction easier also helps our users and sales teams demonstrate the value of our product more quickly than is possible today.

### Level up our enterprise-ready features

How our product works in terms of pricing, upgrade paths, auditing, single sign-on, access control, and so on are essential for enterprise customers with large, complex organizations. In partnership with our Cloud team, we're focused on ensuring that these elements of our product meet and exceed these needs so that when it comes to rolling out Sourcegraph the logistics of getting set up don't get in the way of realizing the value of Big Code search.

### Deliver a unified Code Graph experience

Code Graph solves real problems today, but investing in the polish, user experience, and cross-feature functionality within our product area to make the experience lovable and help us deliver solutions that are more than the sum of the parts. Code insights can lead you to a more detailed search, from which you might launch a more advanced semantic analysis. From here, you might use batch changes to remediate a problem and then document everything you've done in a search notebook. This flow works today, but we can do more to connect these experiences in ways that deliver more value than engaging with them separately.

### Scale the Code Graph for Big Code

We have more and more large customers dealing with a lot of code and complexity at scale. It's important that our platform meets their needs, not just in terms of search performance, but in allowing you to explore and understand complex interrelationships of meaning in source code, at the [world's largest scale](../../company/strategy/index.md#big-code).
