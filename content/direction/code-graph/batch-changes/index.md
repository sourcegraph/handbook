# Vision

#### 1-year vision

> Enterprise developers can easily create changesets across many repositories and codehosts, and track them to completion.

#### 3-year vision

> Developers can easily create changesets across many repositories and codehosts, and track them to completion.

#### 10-year vision

> Automated code changes are a common practice for all developers.

## Mission & Strategy

### Mission

We allow developers to focus on changing their code, without having to do any plumbing. We help them drive changesets to completion without having to rely on spreadsheets and painful coordination. Later on, we want to make it easier to write and run code that changes code.

### Strategy

To deliver our vision, we will:

- First, get adopted by the Sourcegraph customer base, including large enterprises. We will target customers with advanced practices and workflow, and collaborate with them to build a category-defining product that all other companies will use. This is what we are doing today.
- Concurrently, spread usage (MAUs) within our customer base, and make sure we deliver on our success metric (changesets merged).
- Then, create low-effort entry points into Batch Changes, and allow users unfamiliar with the practice of automating code changes to onboard with a smooth learning curve. Make onboarding Batch Changes self-serve for most users, to help our customers be successful and prepare for launching on Cloud.
- Then, release Batch Changes on Sourcegraph Cloud, and test and learn how we can serve individuals and smaller teams.
- Eventually, address the problem end to end by becoming the go-to place for code change tools and recipes.

# Guiding Principles

## Themes

To deliver the strategy, here are the themes we want to focus on for the next 3 years:

- [Enterprise scale](#enterprise-scale)
- [Discovery and onboarding](#discovery-and-onboarding)
- [Adoption through low-effort usage patterns](#adoption-through-low-effort-usage-patterns)
- [Cloud](#cloud)
- [Automate common code changes](#automate-common-code-changes)

### Enterprise scale

Batch Changes is successfully adopted by very large companies, with 10,000s of repositories. While there is no technical limitation for Batch Changes to run at that scale, there are 2 limitations in practice:

- Creating changesets locally takes too long to be practical for very large-scale changes.
- In companies with 10,000s of repositories, it is difficult for batch changes maintainers to understand what repositories they should target with a change, and to analyse the progress of a batch change.

To drive enterprise success and stickiness, we need to:

- Deliver a great experience in creating changesets at enterprise scale (10,000s repositories), resulting in more users onboarding batch changes.
- Allow users to find out where to create batch changes and understand what to do to get changesets merged in batch changes with 1,000s of changesets. This will increase the number of changesets merged, our key success metric.

### Discovery and onboarding

As we go to market, our install base of customers with Batch Changes enabled is growing. Often, a few teams have adopted Batch Changes in a given company, because they were the ones feeling the need at the time. That team is frequently used to making large-scale code changes and building automation, so adopting Batch Changes is easier for them and they later turn into evangelists inside the company. In order to go beyond that beachhead user base within a company, we want to make Batch Changes more discoverable, and self-serve for new users, both as a way to drive adoption within customers and increase value and stickiness, but also to prepare for the self-serve model of Batch Changes on Sourcegraph Cloud. We plan to:

- Make Batch Changes more discoverable within Sourcegraph.
- Provide pathways from Search into Batch Changes.
- Make onboarding self-serve and provide easy ways to get started.

### Adoption through low-effort usage patterns

The main use case for Batch Changes today is to automate creating changesets at scale, then track them to completion. This requires some time investment from users to get familiar with Batch Changes, and also to write the code required to automate code changes. This is great for the platform engineer persona or users that feel the urgency to adopt, but it does not allow for less committed users to discover Batch Changes and form habits.

We have heard from customers that tracking and managing changesets created _outside_ of batch changes is very valuable as it replaces manual tasks: track the status of changes across many teams and make sure they get merged. We think there is an opportunity to offer a low-effort entry point into Batch Changes by allowing users to import changesets easily, and use the tracking and management functions.

We also think we can deliver our vision by offering a way to change code across repositories, without writing code, and directly from the Sourcegraph navigation UI.

We plan to drive usage (MAUs) by implementing low-effort, high-frequency use cases.

### Cloud

We plan to achieve feature parity on Sourcegraph Cloud, including Batch Changes. There are two prerequisites for Batch Changes on Sourcegraph Cloud to be successful:

- Reducing time to value. Sourcegraph Cloud's user base will be primarily individual and commercial customers, at least at the beginning. Today, the value of Batch Changes increases exponentially with the size of a customer's codebase and team. Most customers with a smaller team and codebase do not face a big enough pain to invest the time and effort required to adopt Batch Changes in its present state. To be successful on Sourcegraph Cloud we need to make the time to value of Batch Changes shorter and drive [Adoption through low-effort usage patterns](#adoption-through-low-effort-usage-patterns).
- Improving [Discovery and onboarding](#discovery-and-onboarding).

### Automate common code changes

The most frequent question that our customers ask when onboarding Batch Changes is "how do I write code to change x". Writing code to change code is not trivial, and although there are existing tools, most of them fall short either in usability or in expressivity. Having a way to find or write code that automates the change they want is the first critical step in our customer's job to be done, and is a prerequisite for automation.
By solving that problem, we will:

- Solve for our customer's job to be done (JTBD) end to end.
- Position ourselves to address competition specialized in one use case or language.
- Create defensibility by allowing users to share their code in a registry.

This last step is on the critical path for achieving our 10-year vision, but might not be necessary to achieve our 3-year vision.

# Where we are now

Batch Changes has just proved market fit and is adopted by a dozen customers. We see early adoption across a diverse set of companies, from public technology companies to startups with a few dozen engineers ([Batch Changes dashboard](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/dashboards-next/174)).

Over the first year, we have discovered a repeatable playbook: a platform engineering team, sometimes supported by a developer experience team, adopts Batch Changes to make large-scale code changes. Most of the use cases are relatively simple code changes, such as updating configuration files across many repositories. Some are more complex, such as changing API call sites to ship a breaking change in an internal library. The common denominator is those changes would take a very long time to create and track to completion using a manual approach. Adopting Batch Changes allows the platform team to automate manual work and save time, as well as transition from a model in which they are asking their customer teams to do some work, to a more proactive where they can propose a change themselves and leave customer teams to review and merge.

We have four main learnings from the first year of Batch Changes:

- The key success metric for customers is the number of changesets opened by Batch Changes that eventually get merged. To be successful, we need to increase adoption, and the merge rate of changesets.
- We have discovered that importing, tracking and managing existing changesets that were not created by Batch Changes, is perceived as very useful by customers. However, importing changesets today is clumsy, so this workflow is not very frequently used. We need to improve it and validate the value of this use case. If successful, it could create a low-friction, low-effort entry point into Batch Changes for new users and increase usage frequency and stickiness.
- Batch changes works great for teams with 1,000s of repositories, but gets clumsy to use for companies with 10,000s repositories.
- The job to be done (JTBD) for our customers is changing code at a large-scale. To do so, they need to automate a code change, apply it, then track it to completion. Batch Changes today is addressing applying and tracking changes, but the first many customers ask is "how do I write code that makes change x". To solve for our customers JTBD, we will need to provide an answer to that question.

# What's next and why

## FY 2022 Q3 goals

This quarter, our main goal is to ship an alpha version of [Server-side Batch Changes](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/21018) (SSBC), and to onboard one customer into a POC. SSBC is our top priority because:

- It is essential for Batch Changes to work at [Enterprise scale](#enterprise-scale). Enterprise customers with 10,000s of repositories have a degraded experience today, because they cannot create batch changes with 1,000s of changesets or resource-intensive batch changes in a reasonable amount of time. Server-side Batch Changes will directly impact key customers and prospects such as [1](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customers/issues/1), [2](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customers/issues/3), [3](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customers/issues/2) and [4](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customers/issues/6).
- It will shift the setup burden from the user to the site-admin. Once site-admins have setup SSBC, any user can run a batch change from the GUI in a few clicks. That will unlock improvements to [Discovery and onboarding](#discovery-and-onboarding) such as creating batch changes from a template directly from the GUI. Creating a guided, self-serve onboarding is a prerequisite for [Cloud](#cloud).
- It unlocks [key vision items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MnfaA9P7mtur7aQbMvy2x96_zy_IrOhY-MbGUo5I5wk/edit#heading=h.25ypvomeex1g) that will make using Sourcegraph an incredible experience and delight our customers, as well as [low-effort usage patterns](#adoption-through-low-effort-usage-patterns).

### Top customer, support, sales, and marketing issues

- We are planning to allow users to [Mount file on batch change steps containers](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/14851) after many customer requests.
- We want to [nudge users to ask site-admins to setup webhooks](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/24310). Most customers forget to setup [webhooks](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/references/requirements#batch-changes-effect-on-code-host-rate-limits), which degrades trial experience and creates a lot of support load.

### What we are iterating on

- We are iterating on [bulk actions](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/119?card_filter_query=label%3Abulk-action), to move it from a minimal experience to something that customers love. We lack bandwidth to make radical improvements, but we plan to ship a small increment.

### Non Batch Changes work

This quarter, we are taking on some work outside the scope of Batch Changes to support key business needs.

- Licensing and gating, see [FY22 Q3: Licensing and tier enforcement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o_glLsehadoQQa7bap7Ve5pW_KS30xDgcdq79Fcn4Ow/edit#heading=h.rrqx4mdnmg3q) (private).
- Minimal [CVS support](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/119?card_filter_query=label%3Acvs), to unblock an important [customer](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customers/issues/5).

### What we are not working on

- **Windows support** ([#24849](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/24849)): Reliably supporting creating batch changes locally in a windows environment is a very large amount of work, that is incompatible with our plan of delivering Server-side Batch Changes as fast as possible. Windows support has blocked one [prospect](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customers/issues/3) and slowed down adoption at a [customer](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customers/issues/2), and will likely be important in the Banking and Gaming industry. We plan to address these customers with Server-side Batch Changes. Server-side Batch Changes will bypass the need to run the CLI locally, and instead allow customers to compute the batch changes on the Sourcegraph instance.

- **Adding a permission model**: Batch Changes currently only supports the site-admin and user roles. While finer-grained permissions will likely be needed to reach broad adoption in large companies, we are prioritizing building a product that supports [Enterprise scale](#enterprise-scale) before adding to the permission model. When Server-side Batch Changes is in beta and the user experience at a very large-scale allows for broad adoption, we can reconsider adding more complex permissions and control over who uses Batch Changes.

- Education material about code change tools. Helping our customers find and select a code change tool that suits their needs is a very common ask, and something we think could drive adoption. We don’t have bandwidth for this this quarter though.
