# Company meeting

**What:** A bi-weekly live meeting that takes place every other Tuesday at 15:00 UTC.

**Why:** To come together as a global team to align on company goals and strategy, recap progress/blockers, and create a moment of synchronous connection as a team. This is an important communication touchpoint all teammates should prioritize the time to attend.

**How:** Attend live via Zoom. Invites are automatically sent to your calendar. If we make any changes to the invite, we will notify the team in #announcements.

## Recaps

A member of the Comms team will send a recap of each company meeting in #announce-company, along with the recording, slides, and speaker notes.
