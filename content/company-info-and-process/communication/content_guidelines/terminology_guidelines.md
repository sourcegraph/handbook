# Terminology guidelines

We use certain words in a special way. This word list defines our terminology to make sure we all use the same words for the same things.

## Writing about ourselves

We describe ourselves with a few different names depending on context, and we should use the right term at the right time.

- **Sourcegraph**: Main product. This name is always preferred unless you need to clarify between the 3 deployment methods for Sourcegraph below.
- **Sourcegraph self-hosted**: On-premises and self-managed version of Sourcegraph.
- **Sourcegraph Cloud** Dedicated, single-tenant Sourcegraph instances managed and provisioned by the Sourcegraph team. This was previously referred to as "managed instances."
- **Sourcegraph.com / "dotcom"**: This is the service publicly available at [sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com). It can be used to search top open source repositories.
- **Sourcegraph OSS**: When referring to the build result of the open source repository.
- **Sourcegraph integrations**: The general term for our integrations. When referencing specific integrations:
  - Sourcegraph(’s) Phabricator integration
  - Sourcegraph(’s) GitHub integration
  - Sourcegraph(’s) browser extensions
  - Sourcegraph(’s) Chrome extension
  - Sourcegraph(’s) Firefox add-on
- **Code intelligence platform**: Use when referring to our category or our entire suite of products and features.

You don't need to use the full name of the product each time you refer to it, but don't use a shortened name that could be confused with an official name.

<div class="usage">
<div class="item yes">

##### Yes

- Use the Phabricator integration to get Sourcegraph features in code review.

</div>
<div class="item no">

##### No

- Use the Sourcegraph Phabricator integration to get Sourcegraph features in code review. _(sounds repetitive and stilted)_

</div>
</div>

Always title case our name. Don’t abbreviate or add a space to our name.

<div class="usage">
<div class="item yes">

##### Yes

- Sourcegraph

</div>
<div class="item no">

##### No

- SG
- Source Graph

</div>
</div>

Only use _we_ and _our_ (as in “our GitHub integration”) in informal documents. In documentation or marketing material, depending on the context, just avoid it, or use “the” or “Sourcegraph”.

For example, “use this custom search page for Python 2-to-3 migration code”. When possible, use the more specific names **Search scope page**, a more specific name for a custom search page that describes search pages at /search/scope/SCOPENAME, or **project search page**, a more specific name for a custom search page that describes pages for projects. For example, the Kubernetes project search page to search across all Kubernetes code. |

| regex                | "regexp" or "regular expressions"                | This is to avoid confusion with RegExp in Javascript, and to avoid conflation with "exp" in Warcraft and other MMORPGs. This is relevant as we onboard younger users whose gaming experience is significant. If they're used to "exp" being experience, they will have to pause for a moment to context-switch, thus creating confusion, even temporarily, which isn't a good look.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| repository           | repo                                             | We try to [avoid abbreviations when possible](../content_guidelines/style_and_mechanics.md#abbreviations-acronyms-latinisms-jargon). We habitually shorten words for concepts we work with every day until they become obvious to us, like repo, org, j2d, find-refs, PR, revs... but they aren't obvious to outsiders, which can be confusing and result in a steeper learning curve for new users. In this spirit, we prefer "repository" and "repositories".                                                                                                                                         |
