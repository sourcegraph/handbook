# Announcements

This document describes the standard procedures for how to make announcements to the company. However, unique circumstances may call for deviating from these norms.

## First days

New teammates should post a message in #teammate-announce on their first day introducing themselves to the company! They can include pictures of themselves and/or loved ones, pets, hobbies, or anything else they choose.

## Org changes

If you or your team are planning any organizational changesâ€“ this includes promotions, title changes, team switches, reporting structure changes, team name changes, etc., please notify People Ops in advance of the change going into effect. Any change that affects the company org chart or someone's title should be communicated to People Ops by submitting the change via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpsqWn5acbU2LMCzizpxJBnGDgNoP8Qvj9P3FROO9g5C3yHA/viewform) prior to announcement. People Ops will review the changes and make any necessary to any impacted systems.

**Important:** Notifying People Ops of any org change is crucial to maintaining our HRIS/teammate database (BambooHR) up to date. Many key systems such as our Impact Review platform (Lattice), our PTO platform (Roots), and even our cost centers/budgeting all rely on our HRIS being accurate and up to date.

## Promotions

Managers should post notes celebrating internal promotions in the #teammate-announce channel. We believe that culture is defined in part by who is celebrated, rewarded, and promoted internally, and these announcements are an opportunity to both reward a deserving individual and to remind the rest of the team what behaviors are rewarded.

These posts should cover:

- What the promoted teammate has done to merit promotion
- How the teammate's performance and actions embody [our values](../values/index.md)
- What the teammate's new responsibilities and role will be

## Departures

When a teammate [leaves Sourcegraph](../../departments/people-talent/people-ops/process/leaving.md), the individual's manager should post a brief note in #teammate-announce and cross-posted to the #manager-team channel (and each individual manager can choose to announce that teammate's departure in their next team meeting or in their 1-1s if it is relevant to their team or their projects).

These posts should cover:

- The fact that the teammate is departing
- The date of the teammate's last day at Sourcegraph
- How to connect with them outside of Sourcegraph (e.g., a LinkedIn link)

In the interest of respecting the teammate's privacy, the reason for the departure will only be disclosed on a need-to-know basis. These posts should NOT cover the reason for the departure.

If the teammate chooses, and still has access to Slack, they are free to share any context they may desire.

## Switching Teams

When a teammate [switches teams](../working-at-sourcegraph/switching-teams.md), the teammate's new manager should post a brief note in the #teammate-announce channel announcing the switch and what the teammate's new responsibilities and role will be.
