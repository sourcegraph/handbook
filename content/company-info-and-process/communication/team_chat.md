# How we use Slack at Sourcegraph

### Overview

We use Slack for team chat and real-time announcements. While Slack isn‚Äôt a source of truth, it is an important internal communication tool that helps us stay connected and informed. All teammates are encouraged to join the following company-wide channels to stay informed on news happening across the company. Read on for best practices and processes we follow as a company.

## Slack Guidelines

### Retention policy

Slack is not a [source of truth](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/handbook@2f4a8affc57038a0bf149f296581cb8cacde57d1/-/blob/content/company-info-and-process/communication/index.md#sources-of-truth) which means important updates that may be shared in Slack should be reflected in a [source of truth](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/handbook@2f4a8affc57038a0bf149f296581cb8cacde57d1/-/blob/content/company-info-and-process/communication/index.md#sources-of-truth). To enforce this, only 180 days of Slack activity in public channels is retained.

- <sub>**Important:** You must notify Tech Ops (in #Tech-Ops) when you create a new channel requiring an exception to the default 180-day rule (even if it falls into an existing exception). **We have no way to know when new channels requiring an exception are created.** Exception requests will be reviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis.</sub>

### Naming conventions

To help with navigation and discoverability, follow these naming conventions for channels. If you see find a channel that does not follow these, request to rename it in #ask-it-tech-ops.

### Manadatory channels for all teammates

_All teammates are automatically added to these channels when they join Sourcegraph, and they should check them regularly._

## Slack best practices

### Keep you profile up to date and easy to find

Help your teammates learn more about you by completing your profile. As you fill out your profile, don't forget to upload a profile photo. Your photo makes it easier for your teammates to know who you are in Slack. All teammates should add the following to their profile:

- Full name: First and Last Name
- Display name: First and Last Name
- Title: Your role at Sourcegraph
- Time zone: Keep this up to date so teammates know when to reach you

_Consider also adding:_

- Pronouns
- Name recording
- Name pronunciation

### Set a channel description and conversation topic

When you create a Slack channel (regardless of if it's public or private) you should add a description to your conversations to let people know what kind of information they can expect to find there.

Any member of a channel can add or edit a description or topic to let people know what the channel is used for and what is currently being discussed. Descriptions are visible when viewing channel details, or when searching for channels on your desktop. Topics are visible in the conversation header.

### Use emoji reactions to reduce the noise in Slack

An emoji reaction can often replace the need for a follow-up message. You can hover over or tap and hold reactions in a conversation to see who added them. We use the following emojis at Sourcegraph to quickly acknowledge and respond to requests in Slack.

- `Ack` = I acknowledge I‚Äôve seen this. Action not needed.
- üëÄ = I‚Äôve seen it, I‚Äôm reviewing it
- ‚úÖ = I‚Äôve seen it, my action is complete
- üëç = I agree

#### Custom emoji

All teammates are able to upload their own custom emoji to our Slack Workspace. When adding a new animated emoji, keep in mind that rapidly changing or flashing emoji, such as the iconic party parrot, may not be friendly for teammates who are [impacted by photosensitivity or susceptible to seizures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/jzmjdx/seizure_inducing_emojis/).

If you spot a custom emoji that may be a bit too animated, report it to #ask-it-tech-ops so it can be removed.

### Use threads to organize discussions and reduce noise

Threads help you create organized discussions around specific messages. They let you discuss a topic in more detail without adding clutter to a channel or direct message (DM) conversation.

When a thread reaches a point where a decision is made and that information would be useful to the entire channel, be sure to communicate that decision back to the channel by using the ‚Äúalso send to #channel‚Äù button.

If you need to start a new topic of conversation, post directly in the channel to start a new thread.

### Default to Public channels

Sourcegraph is an all remote and asynchronous-first company, and we work out in the open via public channels to help teammates stay informed. Default to using public channels and if you know who will likely have the answer, mention that person directly. This ensures it is easy for other people to chime in if they have the answer, and helps other people observe and learn.

Private channels will automatically be created for the following categories of conversations:

- Recruiting: Channels used for discussing specific positions where private candidate feedback and details will be discussed.
- Management: Channels where managers can communicate about specific private or sensitive team situations.
- Legal: Channels with legally sensitive information, such as acquisition discussions or communication with outside parties where we have a legal requirement to keep information sharing limited.
- Affinity groups: Channels for affinity groups that prefer a private space.

If you would like a channel to be made private, and it does not fit in the categories above, please acquire pre-approval from your manager before contacting #ask-it-tech-ops to make a channel private.

### Organize Slack to make it work for you

To help you keep track of important conversations, you can star a channel or direct message (DM). Starred conversations appear in the Starred section of your sidebar. You can also organize your channels, direct messages (DMs), and apps into custom sections within your sidebar. Your custom sections are only visible to you and won't affect what your teammates see, so set them up however you‚Äôd like. [Watch this video for a few examples.](https://slack.com/help/articles/4411352432275-Video--Organize-your-conversations-in-Slack)

### Send (and read) messages any time

Because Sourcegraph is a global, [all-remote company](../remote/index.md) with [flexible work hours](../remote/index.md#is-there-an-expectation-to-work-over-the-weekends), teammates should feel free to send messages to others at any time, rather than trying to guess what a convenient time would be for the other party (or parties) involved.

In turn, you are free to read your message whenever it is convenient for you. There is no expectation that people will be responsive over the [weekend/vacation/evening/etc.](../remote/index.md#is-there-an-expectation-to-work-over-the-weekends).

Make sure to set up Slack to only send you notifications when you want to see them!

### Archive old and unused channels

To keep the Sourcegraph workspace on Slack organized, easy to navigate, and up to date, archive channels when they are no longer needed. First, send a final message in the channel notifying its members that you are going to archive the channel, allow 24 hours for any objections, then archive the channel.
