# Sourcegraph open source project FAQ

This document is about the Sourcegraph _open source project_, not the product or features of Sourcegraph.

## What kinds of contributions are accepted?

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What license is Sourcegraph released under?

Sourcegraph OSS is released under the [Apache 2 license](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/LICENSE.apache). Sourcegraph OSS comprises all files in this repository except those in the `enterprise/` and `src/enterprise/` directories.

All files in the `enterprise/` and `src/enterprise/` directories are subject to the [Sourcegraph Enterprise license](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Is all of Sourcegraph open source?

All files in this repository except those in the `enterprise/` and `client/web/src/enterprise/` directories are open source, and build a product known as Sourcegraph OSS. Sourcegraph OSS omits certain trademarks, logos, and [paid enterprise features](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/) from the official Sourcegraph build to [make it open source](../product-engineering/product/licensing.md).

The official, free Sourcegraph build is called Sourcegraph Core and includes these additions (the source code of which is available in the `/enterprise` and `/src/enterprise` directories and is covered by the [Sourcegraph Enterprise license](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/LICENSE)). The reason why we include these features in the official build is to provide a smooth upgrade path to Sourcegraph Enterprise (you can just supply a license key to activate the features, with no migration necessary).

> NOTE: To build a 100% open source `sourcegraph/server` image, use `dev/dev-sourcegraph-server.sh`.
