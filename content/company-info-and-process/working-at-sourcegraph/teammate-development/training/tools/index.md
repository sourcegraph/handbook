# Tools we use

## Computer: Mac

We use Mac as our standarized laptops. You can read more about why [here](../../../../../departments/tech-ops/tools/computer-setup.md).

You can get a quick view of how to use a [Mac laptop here](https://help.apple.com/macOS/high-sierra/mac-basics/#/intro)

[Get started with Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl3a2c2cb0/12.0/mac/12.0). We suggest you click on **Table of Contents +** to find the resources you need. "The Mac desktop", "Basics", "Apps" and "Customise your Mac" sections are the main ones to get yourself started if you've never used a Mac before.

Here are a few first step guides that you might find useful:

- [Dock](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh35859/mac)
- [Customise your Mac with System Preferences](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh15217/12.0/mac/12.0)
- [Notifications](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40583/12.0/mac/12.0)
- [Trackpad and Mouse](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh35869/mac)
- [Finder on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2605/mac)
- [Full screen](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl9c21d2be/mac)
- [Touch ID](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl16fbf90a/12.0/mac/12.0)

If you are a visual learner, we recommend seaching for YouTube videos that show steps on how to use Mac computers for beginners.

## Slack

Slack is the messaging app we use to connect people to the information they need. Slack organizes conversations into channels, where everyone can come together in one place to share ideas, make decisions and move work forward. It helps teams operate faster and stay in sync, wherever they are. At Sourcegraph, we consider it an async tool (you can read more about [asynchronous work here](../../../../communication/asynchronous-communication.md)) but it can be a very quick synchronous tool too.

## PTO by Deel

[PTO by Deel](https://www.tryroots.io/pto) is our paid time off (PTO) management system that is hosted within Slack. PTO by Deel allows all teammates to notify their manager and delegate any tasks during their PTO to appropriate teammates directly via Slack’s interface. As a manager, you are able to pull reports on your team’s historical and upcoming PTO.

Please note: we do not use BambooHR’s PTO request system. If your direct report submits a PTO request via BambooHR, please hit “reject” and direct them to PTO by Deel to resubmit.

⚡️ You will notice that under "Apps" in your Slack, you'll see "PTO by Deel" – so you should be able to view all your existing PTO events and it's where you'll go to submit all PTO events moving forward (this includes public holidays)!

📆  Make sure to sync your calendar (on the home page of "PTO by Deel" app in Slack) to ensure that all your PTO events also sync to your and your manager's Google Calendar.

_Keep in mind that PTO by Deel creates a day event and not an OOO event_. This means that your events won't be canceled or rejected. Once you've submitted your time off via PTO by Deel, go to your calendar and create an OOO event for the days you'll be out.
We also recommend you invite your team to the event PTO by Deel created.
