# Tools we use

TODO

## Loom
Loom is a video messaging tool that helps us foster our asynchronous communications. Read more about how we use Loom, guidelines for using it properly and a quick training [here](loom.md).


## Roots
[Roots](https://www.tryroots.io/pto) is our paid time off (PTO) management system that is hosted within Slack. Roots allows all teammates to notify their manager and delegate any tasks during their PTO to appropriate teammates directly via Slack’s interface. As a manager, you are able to pull reports on your team’s historical and upcoming PTO.

Please note: we do not use BambooHR’s PTO request system. If your direct report submits a PTO request via BambooHR, please hit “reject” and direct them to Roots to resubmit.

### Roots training
