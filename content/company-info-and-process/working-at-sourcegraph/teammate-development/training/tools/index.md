# Tools we use

TODO

## Loom

Loom is a video messaging tool that helps us foster our asynchronous communications. Read more about how we use Loom, guidelines for using it properly and a quick training [here](loom.md).

## Roots

[Roots](https://www.tryroots.io/pto) is our paid time off (PTO) management system that is hosted within Slack. Roots allows all teammates to notify their manager and delegate any tasks during their PTO to appropriate teammates directly via Slack‚Äôs interface. As a manager, you are able to pull reports on your team‚Äôs historical and upcoming PTO.

Please note: we do not use BambooHR‚Äôs PTO request system. If your direct report submits a PTO request via BambooHR, please hit ‚Äúreject‚Äù and direct them to Roots to resubmit.

‚ö°Ô∏è You will notice that under "Apps" in your Slack, you'll see "PTO by Roots" ‚Äì so you should be able to view all your existing PTO events and it's where you'll go to submit all PTO events moving forward (this includes public holidays)!

üìÜ¬† Make sure to sync your calendar (on the home page of "PTO by Roots" app in Slack) to ensure that all your PTO events also sync to your and your manager's Google Calendar.

_Keep in mind that Roots creates a day event and not an OOO event_.¬†This means that your events won't be canceled or rejected. Once you've submitted your time off via Roots, go to your calendar and create an OOO event for the days you'll be out.
We also recommend you invite your team to the event Roots created.
