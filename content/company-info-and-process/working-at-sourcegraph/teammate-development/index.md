# High Performance Culture & Teammate Development

The purpose of this Handbook Page is to provide Managers and Teammates with the resources needed to foster a high performing culture at Sourcegraph. We believe that our team thrives when we have a high bar for excellence, and when all Teammates receive feedback early and often.

## What is a high performance culture?

A high performance culture is one that consistently supports and promotes outstanding results and achievement by all Teammates. We want a culture where Teammates are highly productive and motivated, with clear expectations set and communicated for high quality work and expected outcomes.

Our Teammates should understand what's expected of them, have the resources necessary to meet and exceed their goals, feel supported by their Manager, be aligned with our company values, and feel confident in leadership. High performance cultures benefit both the company and the individual.

## Why is a high performance culture important?

Members of high-performing teams share a mutual purpose, are goal-oriented, collaborative through strong teamwork and partnership, and are hyper-focused on achieving clear, outstanding results. Being surrounded by high-performers makes all of us better. We want to give Managers and Teammates resources to build a high-performing team.

We **hold our Managers accountable** to foster high-performing teams by giving clear feedback early and often, and providing explicit direction on what is expected of Teammates in their role.

Similarly, we **expect our Teammates to give direct feedback** to their Manager and peers. Giving and receiving direct, transparent feedback is core to our values and we expect both Managers and individual contributors to follow through on this commitment.

## How we foster a high performance culture

We foster a high performance culture by recruiting high performers, setting clear standards of excellence, and providing continuous feedback and continuous performance management. We expect performance to be measured and discussed directly and continuously because learning and growth are constant. Put simply, when Managers prioritize collaborative, transparent, and supportive performance management practices, our Teammates are more engaged and ultimately more successful.

We expect Managers to foster a high-performance culture and provide performance feedback in the following ways:

1. [Formal performance (impact) reviews](#formal-performance-impact-reviews)
2. [Ongoing feedback](#ongoing-feedback)

In sitations of underperformance, which may be identified during ongoing feedack or formal impact reviews, Managers should consult with their People Partner and follow [this guidance for addressing underperformance](addressing-underperformance.md).

#### Formal performance (impact) reviews

At Sourcegraph, we have a formal performance (impact) review process that takes place **twice a year.**

- 1st review period of the year: launches in February
- 2nd review period of the year: launches in August

The purpose of our semi-annual reviews, which take place via Lattice, is to gather formal feedback from the Teammate, their Manager, and their Peers.

Our impact review process is explained in detail [here](../../../departments/people-talent/people-ops/process/teammate-sentiment/impact-reviews/index.md).

#### Ongoing feedback

We expect our Managers to provide ongoing, continuous feedback in the following ways:

1. [Direct communication & immediate feedback / coaching](#direct-communication)
2. [Regular 1:1s](#regular-11s)
3. [Quarterly career development conversations](#quarterly-career-development-conversations)

##### Direct communication

The follow describes our expectations for how Managers champion a culture of continuous feedback:

![Direct Communication Expectations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7228359/233812769-d5e9ef06-4a6e-4a98-bea0-05840f303f86.jpg)

##### Regular 1:1s

We **expect Managers** to host regular, recurring 1:1s with their team. 1:1s are a great forum to facilitate ongoing, direct communication, engagement, and trust-building between Managers and their direct reports. We highly recommend that Managers meet with their direct reports either weekly or bi-weekly.

We **expect Teammates** to ask for critical feedback and whether they are meeting or exceeding expectations during every 1:1. There should never be any question with respect to how a Teammate is performing, and whether or not they are meeting expectations.

We expect Managers to cover the following topics during 1:1s:

- Personal check-in. Everyone at Sourcegraph cares about Teammates’ well-being in and out of work.
- Status update on key projects.
- Direct feedback on performance. Managers should share performance feedback during **every single 1:1**.
  - If giving negative feedback, Managers are expected to provide specific examples and follow the [SBI (situation, behavior, impact) model](https://www.the10minuteleader.com/how-to-give-good-feedback/).
- Managers should solicit direct feedback from Teammates (“What should I start / stop / continue?”, “How happy are you?,” Is there anything I can do to better support you?,” etc).

##### Quarterly career-development conversations

Managers should designate at least one conversation per quarter that includes intentional focus time to discuss Teammate career growth. Creating intentional time for forward-looking conversations helps Teammates explore their careers on their own terms, and engage with their Manager in identifying opportunities to grow, learn, and be curious within our own organization.

## Addressing Underperformance

In situations of underperformance, which may be identified during ongoing feedback or formal impact reviews, Managers should consult with their People Partner and follow [this guidance for addressing underperformance](addressing-underperformance.md).

The following are best practice intended to help both Managers and Teammates navigate performance concerns early on:

- Have difficult conversations early to avoid a lag in addressing performance concerns.
- Be direct and have specific, concrete examples to share with the Teammate while communicating clear expectations.
- Avoid favoritism (for example, assigning a certain Teammate more favorable tasks, giving them special attention/coaching, or sharing work-related information with only certain employees).
- Ask yourself - would you hire this person again?
- Hold yourself and the team member accountable to achieving established goals.
- Anchor expectations to objective performance requirements based on established career frameworks.
  - _[Career frameworks across all roles at Sourcegraph](../../../company-info-and-process/working-at-sourcegraph/career-frameworks.md) are in development. If no career framework is in place for the role, align on expectations with your Manager._
- Ensure the teammate is clear on expectations and has the resources necessary to successfully perform against stated expectations.
