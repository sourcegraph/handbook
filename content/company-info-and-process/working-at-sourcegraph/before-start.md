If you feel like starting to get ready before your start date, feel free to begin ordering the supplies you'll need to be successful on day one. We provide new teammates with a budget of up to $2000 to spend on their office setup. This can include a new chair, desk, monitor, headphones, and more. For interns, we provide a budget of up to $925, which includes only electronic items mentioned [here](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/spending-company-money.md).

## US teammates

### 🔍 **Employment verification**

You will need to present valid employment documents within your first three days at Sourcegraph (you can find a list of acceptable documents [here](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-acceptable-documents)). Please have them ready by then.

### ⚖️ **Benefits**

As of January 2022, benefit eligibility begins on your first day. Keep in mind that when you get your credentials will depend on when you set everything up.

### 💸 **Getting Paid**

Sourcegraph is on a semi-monthly payroll cycle. Paychecks are the 15th and last day of every month (or the closest business day prior to those dates). You will receive an email from our payroll team, with a link to set up your payroll and benefits through [Rippling](../../departments/people-talent/people-ops/tools/people-ops-faqs.md#sts=Q.%20Where%20and%20when%20do%20I%20receive%20my%20Rippling%20invitation?).

Keep in mind that teammates starting on the day before any given payday will receive their first paycheck on the following payday.

## Non-US teammates

### 💸 **Getting Paid**

If you will be on a contracting structure where you submit an invoice at the end of each month to be paid once a month, please read more about the invoicing process and find resources [here](../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/invoices.md).
