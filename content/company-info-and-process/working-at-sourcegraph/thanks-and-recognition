## Recognition and #thanks

Giving recognition to your teammates is critical for maintaining a positive, innovative company culture. At Sourcegraph, we encourage regular, public recognition via our #thanks Slack channel.

*When to use the #thanks channel*
The #thanks channel can be used any time you want to recognize and thank a teammate. Some common examples include:
- Thanking a teammate for significant contributions on a project
- Thanking a teammate who helped you solve a problem
- Recognizing a teammate who displayed [Sourcegraph’s values](../values.md)
- Congratulating a teammate on a recent accomplishment

You can also scroll through the #thanks Slack channel history to see recent examples.

*How do we use this channel?*
Anyone at Sourcegraph can send a message in the #thanks channel. Both managers and teammates are encouraged to use the channel regularly. Managers are reminded to recognize one or more of their teammates _at least_ on a monthly basis.

*Best practices for using the #thanks channel*

*Be direct.* Tag the teammates you’re recognizing in your slack message
*Focus on the positive.* Praise in public, criticize in private. 
*Be specific with your praise.* What is the specific behavior you are praising? Praise genuine behaviors. You don’t have to wait for significant events to reinforce good work.
*Be Timely.* The sooner the praise is delivered, the more powerful. 
*Be Sincere.* Mean what you say and deliver the praise in a genuine manner. People want sincere meaningful praise. 
*Be consistent.* Consistently recognizing good work will help create a positive work culture and encourage others to do their best. It's important to recognize people regularly, not just once in a while.

*Why is recognition important*
Employee recognition is important because it:
- Boosts morale and motivation: Recognition shows when hard work is valued and appreciated, which can help boost morale and motivation.
- Increases job satisfaction: Teammates who feel appreciated and valued are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs. 
- Builds a positive work culture: Recognition helps to create a positive work culture by fostering a sense of teamwork and collaboration among teammates.
- Increases loyalty and commitment: Teammates who feel valued and appreciated are more likely to be loyal and committed to their organization, which can help to improve retention rates.
- Improves performance: Recognition can help to improve teammate performance by providing positive reinforcement and encouraging employees to continue working hard.
