# Sourcegraph: open product, open company, open source

As part of making Sourcegraph open source, we build Sourcegraph with a public ([strategy](../../strategy-goals/strategy/index.md) and [issues](http://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/)). As an **open product**, and **open company**, our [website](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about) and [documentation](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/doc) is now open source which holds product- and company-related docs.

Here's how we define these terms:

## Open product

This means the [product strategy](../../strategy-goals/strategy/index.md) is public and open for input.

You might not realize it, but the products you use every day are not just open source; they are also open products. Products like [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date) and [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Iteration-Plans) do all their product planning in the open. They get useful input from the community and make it easy to integrate and rely on their products.

## Open company

This means that principles, strategies, and processes for internal company functions are publicly documented in [our handbook](../../index.md), including for recruiting, marketing, pricing, and salesâ€”not just engineering and product.

Being an open company is important because being an open product isn't enough to gain the trust of developers. You need to do the same for other important parts of the company that affect the product, the open source project, and the users. See [GitLab's pricing strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/pricing/) in their public handbook for a great example of this.

Open company doesn't mean that everything is public; only principles, strategies, and processes related to our internal functions. We're proud to be sharing more about how we run Sourcegraph Inc!

## Open source

To learn more about what **open source** means at Sourcegraph, see the [open source FAQs](../community/faq.md) and [license documentation](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph#license).
