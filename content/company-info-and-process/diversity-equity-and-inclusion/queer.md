# Cohort for LGBTQUIA2s+

_Known informally by the name of the group’s private Slack channel, #queer._ 

## What is the cohort?

The cohort is an employee-led opt-in group for fostering inclusivity, community, and connectedness amongst members of the LGBTQIA2S+ community. The cohort fits the traditional definition of an “Employee Resource Group (ERG)” (a network of employees who share certain characteristics, background, or experiences that is sponsored by the organization they work for), but for the purposes of keeping the group’s methodology light and unrestrictive, we prefer in most settings to refer to it as a “cohort” instead.

## Who can join the cohort?

Employees that fall under the umbrella of the LGBTQIA2S+ category are welcome to join. The group aims not to be prescriptive about membership categories, so if employees are interested in joining, they are welcome to do so. (The group does not audit identification with a particularly queer identity, and leaves employees to decide if the group is appropriate for them.) The group defaults to a big tent posture.

As with anything here, anyone who participates in the cohort is expected to abide by Sourcegraph’s [code of conduct](../communication/code_of_conduct.md).

## What is the mission of the cohort?

The cohort is intended as a gathering place for queer Sourcegraphers to meet and socialize, as well as discussing issues (gender-affirming medical care, same-sex partner benefits, government policies which impact queer and trans people, etc.) that may impact members particularly.

## How is the cohort operated?

Currently, the cohort's activity is focused on #queer, the locked Slack channel which members are invited to join. Members are welcome (and encouraged!) to start events such as happy hours/coffee chats or lunches, but no events are currently planned in an ongoing fashion.
