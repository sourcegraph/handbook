# Surfacing feedback to the product team

> If you're working with a specific customer on a bug or issue and need to directly involve a product engineering team, please refer to [engaging other teams](../ce/engaging-other-teams.md). 

CEs, CSEs, sales, marketing, engineering, and other teammates that interact directly with Sourcegraph users and/or Sourcegraph itself should share product feedback with the product team. 

We deeply value this feedback, so we make this process as frictionless for teammates as possible: 

## Post the feedback in [`#feedback`](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C0W2E592M) on Slack

You're welcome to tag teammates or teams, but that's not necessary – once the feedback is in [#feedback](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C0W2E592M) the product team will [make sure it's routed correctly](product_management/responding_to_user_feedback.md#slack-feedback-channel).  

## When to create a GitHub issue

If you have gotten a specific feedback requests that a customer(s) would like to track the progress of and a GitHub issue for the feedback [does not already exist](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues), you can document this in a [new GitHub issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=customer_feedback.md&title=) to share with the customer. 

GitHub issues with the `#feedback` label will automatically post to the #feedback Slack channel on creation; you do not need to manually copy the issue link into #feedback. 

Because a shareable issue is by definition public, you should not include any private customer information. You should still include things like the customer name, by including a link to the customer in Salesforce.

If you need to create an issue with more specific customer information, you should [create a new issue in Sourcegraph/Customer](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/new/choose), which is private. You can then link that to a public issue in Sourcegraph/Sourcegraph.

## What if the feedback is [a possible exception]? 

There are no exceptions to the above process! Please do post all product feedback to the #feedback channel – **this includes feedback that you feel might be: minor, not worth surfacing, too harsh, just a personal opinion, or from you rather than a customer**. All feedback helps us make Sourcegraph the best product possible. 

## If you are uncomfortable posting the feedback 

If you are uncomfortable posting feedback directly to #feedback for any reason at all, you are very welcome to DM it on Slack to any [member of the product team](index.md#members). They will make sure it reaches the right folks. In some cases, this may mean they post the feedback to slack after removing any possible connection to you.
