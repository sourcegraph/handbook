# Pricing features

This is a guide for product managers on how to think about pricing and tiering your features.

## Pricing tiers

We have two pricing tiers, free (for up to ten users) and enterprise. Our free tier allows users to try the product in a self-service way before they buy, and enterprise allows us to charge our users in a fair, understandable way once they see the value.

## Add-on features

We also sell add-on features that are at additional cost to the enterprise tier, such as Batch Changes. This allows for flexibility in the features that our customers want to pay for, where if they don't see the value of something they don't need to pay for it. This helps them manage their usage and cost.

## Philosophy

### Role of the free tier

A lot of our features are available in our free tier, so that people can really see the value of the product before they buy. Instead of limiting access to what they are able to do (which limits the value they get out of the free tier), we limit the number of users to ten so that they need to upgrade if they are really start using it at their company. We believe that the product is so great that, once adoption starts, it will continue and these companies will convert to paying customers.

### Clear upgrade path

Our upgrade path from free -> enterprise -> add-ons should be logical and make sense for the user. For example, having features that only large enterprises use in the free tier doesn't make a lot of sense; the people in that tier aren't benefiting from it, and we miss the chance to add clear value to our enterprise tier for enterprise customers.

Conversely, gating a lot of important daily use cases out of free (or even enterprise) can make it feel like these features don't provide real value.

To avoid these scenarios we should be mindful of the user experience at each step in the upgrade path, and ensure there is a flow that makes sense for each product area.

### Cloud, on-prem, and managed

We offer three deployment models for the product, but as a default practice we provide consistency in feature-based availability and cost across all three. Operational costs are passed on to the customer depending on the deployment model, but that does play a factor in feature pricing.

### Avoid moving features from free to paid

We try to avoid moving features from free to paid as this can be difficult to explain to customers. At that point, you're taking something away from people which is something that we don't want to do. It creates a bad feeling, and also can be complex when dealing with an open core product (a feature may have been contributed to the free version, and making it paid can feel like unfair monetization of something that was donated.)

It is much better to move a feature from paid to free, so if unsure you can start a feature as paid and move it down to free later if it ends up not being an actual driver of revenue.

## Choosing between free and enterprise

This section is to be determined; in the meantime please work with Product Leadership to determine which tier a new major feature should go into.

## Choosing the price for add-on features

This section is to be determined; in the meantime please work with Product Leadership to determine the price for new major features that will be charged as add-ons.
