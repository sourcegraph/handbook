# Planning

Planning is a continuous process of negotiation between product and engineering. Teams should review the [roadmap](../index.md#roadmap) weekly with the [Product Manager](../roles/index.md#product-manager) and update it regularly. The roadmap will become less specific and focus more on the problems we are looking to solve the further out it gets. We expect to learn a lot between defining the problem and implementation. As implementation details change and we learn more about the solution to the problem we are aiming to solve, the product manager is responsible for communicating impacts to the overall coherency of a release.

## Product / eng team backlogs

You can find the backlogs for the product teams by visiting their [individual direction pages](../index.md#roadmap). For tracking implementation teams are using different tools and processes to plan their work, such as Jira, Productboard, or GitHub issues.

## Planning artifacts

Planning requires several artifacts for communicating. This section clarifies how each artifact is used in the planning process.

### Goals

[Goals](../../company/goals/index.md) align teams with the company's goals. They should be used to make prioritization [decisions](../../communication/decisions.md) and help to maintain team direction and focus.

### Roadmap

[The roadmap](../index.md#roadmap) is where we track and prioritize larger projects that we intend to finish in the next 3-6 months.

Engineering should feel empowered to add items to the roadmap that they feel strongly about, which will start conversations with product. [We want to push decisions down to people closest to those problems](../../communication/decisions.md#what-makes-an-effective-decision). It is product's responsibility to help give insight into customer pains and feedback, strategic priorities, and to ensure consistency across the product.

The roadmap is NOT:

- a comprehensive backlog of everything we want to do
- a list of every bug or customer issue in our issue tracker
- permanent or mandated

The roadmap is:

- a prioritized list of the most important things we intend to do
- an indicator of relative priority to teams, customers, and users
- a place for discussions about priority
- where engineering and product negotiate the next most important thing to work on

Teams should work on the next thing at the top of the roadmap and should not jump around. If there is a desire to work on something lower on the roadmap, that should be elevated during team meetings and the change in priority should be discussed. That item should be moved in the roadmap based on the outcome of the discussion.

We ask that teams leverage the [Direction page template](direction_template.md) when creating and updating their team's page in [the roadmap](../index.md#roadmap).

### OKRs and One-pagers

To ensure our team objectives are aligned with the company objectives at each fiscal quarter boundary the product and engineering organization collaborate with leadership on team [one pagers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iX7ytN8FztLXjl830XtNlI0KxfxFYFSOUUjtgSnmOPA/edit#heading=h.4nkrzeavd0fi). Once the objectives in the one pagers are agreed on the content of the one pages should be reflect on the [roadmap](../index.md#roadmap). This generally happens in the first week of the fiscal quarter. As the quarter progresses the product manager is responsible for communicating progress towards our objectives in the [OKR tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7xgQuKTkxhAlOU2bZgnp5EjJgptwxNJXBkOJaomm5w/edit#gid=628032573) so that we can stay aligned.

### RFCs

[RFCs](../../communication/rfcs/index.md) are documents used to outline and solicit feedback on projects. They provide context around a problem that needs to be solved and are a medium for creating specifications for a project.

Generally, items in the roadmap will be big enough they require writing an RFC, though this will not always be the case. When a solution is clear, a well-detailed issue is sufficient to communicate intent, motivation, and solution.
