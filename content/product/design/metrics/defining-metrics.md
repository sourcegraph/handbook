# Metrics

The locations and interaction moments where events will be collected for use in Sourcegraph's product analytics tools often must be defined within design artifacts.

To define a metric, designers should use a [metric card](https://www.figma.com/file/8qNcDzOXLj1hcOM76WDPN9/%F0%9F%9B%A0Project-Tools?node-id=2597%3A6172) from the project tools library. These cards help standardize the names and description of metrics across the product.

Follow the [guidelines for naming events](../../../bizops/amplitude.md#adding-events-to-amplitude) when defining an event.

- If a large number of events are being collected, consider creating a Metrics page in Figma ([example](https://www.figma.com/file/LfQUGTLvfYWxyuFoyQsptB/?node-id=251%3A7408)) to identify the locations and interactions where events will be collected.
- Metrics review: consider requesting a review of your metrics definitions from the analytics team before the project goes to development.
