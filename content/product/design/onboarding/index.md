# Onboarding

Welcome to the Design Team!

Having gone though [the Process St onboarding](https://app.process.st/reports/) and [the Product onboarding](../../onboarding/index.md), it's time for the Design onboarding!

Your perspective as both a new user of Sourcegraph and a new teammate is very valuable to us. Please keep notes on any issues you encounter as you are onboarding and learning the product. Weâ€™ll use those notes to improve the product and process.

## Designer checklist

- Add your name to the [Project card](https://www.figma.com/file/8qNcDzOXLj1hcOM76WDPN9/ðŸ› Project-Tools?node-id=1%3A203) designer list
- Check if you're added to the Design Team group on Slack. Join the design-related channels:
  - design
  - product-design-internal
  - accessibility
  - analytics-review
  - wildcard-components-library-wcl
  - hallway-testing
- Make sure that your Name is set to your First and Last name on GitHub so that other teammates can easily indentify you. Go to GitHub -> Your profile -> Edit profile -> Fill out the 'Name field' -> Save
- Add yourself as a designer to the handbook pages of the teams you're working with. You can also add those teams to your Slack profile description, for ex. 'Product Designer (Code Insights)'
- Get familiar with the products that we use as inspirations for reference in the developer tools industry:
  - code hosts: [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab] (https://gitlab.com/)
  - code editors: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (and other IDEs like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/))
  - similar products: [grepp.app](https://grep.app/)
- Add yourself to the design club meeting on Tuesdays
- Read the [Product Design team handbook](../index.md) content
