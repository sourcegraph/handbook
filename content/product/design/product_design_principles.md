# Sourcegraph’s design principles

Sourcegraph’s product design principles are how we express our shared vision and values while designing for our product.
We use our principles to:

- To help our team make **consistent decisions**.
- To **provide constraints** that lead to better outcomes.
- To **resolve ambiguity** when faced with options that provide value among different dimensions.
- To build a **shared vision** across our design and product team.

Our principles were [co-created](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zRbtZR68ZITYypSAJJ63Ir_fFPxJfTtidJmsrxUXW7o/edit#) with members of the design, product, and frontend application teams, and benefit:

- Designers.
- Product managers.
- Engineers.
- Marketing.
- And other stakeholders involved in the design process.

## Our principles

- **A personal tool within a larger workflow**<br />
  Sourcegraph is a powerful yet personal tool that exists within a larger workflow. Design for familiar patterns with thoughtful defaults, while embracing personalization and adaptability.

- **Made for everyone**<br />
  Our purpose is to make it so everyone can code. This demands we make Sourcegraph accessible and useful for all developers through universal, inclusive design.

- **Gracefully manage complexity**<br />
  Sourcegraph supports complex product requirements, but also empowers users to manage this complexity for their individual needs.

- **Code as content**<br />
  More time is spent reading than writing code. Elevate the craft of code as content.

- **Trust is earned**<br />
  Sourcegraph is the source of truth, but this trust is earned. Accuracy, transparency, recency, and honesty together work to uphold this source of truth.

- **Create momentum**<br />
  Help developers create and maintain flow. To do this, Sourcegraph must be fast in every way. We design purposefully to help users iterate and build momentum.
