# Research

As a design team, we carry out research in a variety of forms depending on our research goals. Sometimes this research takes place at the beginning of a project, during the discovery phase. Other times, it takes place at the end of a project after shipping a design outcome.

Some specific methods we use:

- **Internal user interviews.** As our users are primarily developers, our own Sourcegraph developers are great interview participants. (However, we need to remember that our own developers are generally very experienced in the area of code search, which results in implicit bias that we must account for in synthesis.)
- **External user interviews.** Existing and prospective customers, participants we find through outreach on social media, and other sources are all great participants for research activities.
- **Hallway testing.** When we want to test our ideas using interactive prototypes or even in the product itself, our own team members make great participants. (However, we need to remember that our own team members are generally very experienced in the area of code search, which results in implicit bias that we must account for in synthesis.)
- **Unmoderated user testing.** When unmoderated user testing is valuable we use [usertesting.com](../tools/index.md#product-design-and-research) to conduct unmoderated user research with a pool of participants sourced by usertesting.com.
- **Moderated user testing.** When moderated user testing is valuable, we use [LookBack](../tools/index.md#product-design-and-research) to conduct sessions. With LookBack, other team members can observe and take notes in real time without appearing to the participant, which makes for a more positive participation experience.
- **Competitive and analogous research.** It's worthwhile to see how other tools and platforms are solving parallel problems. We usually keep screenshots and references in artifacts like RFCs and in project Figma files.
- **Existing artifact analysis.** Our users are passionate and provide excellent, regular feedback that we keep in tools like [Productboard](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/).

After research is complete, we publish our findings in a Google Doc and share with the project team, and the broader company. Research findings are valuable for future reference, so it's worth making sure they're [well-crafted asynchronous design artifacts](../artifacts/index.md).

## Helpful links to share with user research participants and observers

We've found that moderated user research goes more smoothly, and is more approachable, when both participants and observers know what to expect. We've created two resources you can share ahead of time to make your research more successful:

- [So you’re about to participate in user testing](../../user_research/user_research_participant.md)
- [So you’re about to help us with user testing](../../user_research/user_research_observer.md)
