# Visual design checklist

This checklist is intended to be suggestions and important considerations when finalizing a design artifact, rather than a prescriptive list of requirements.

This checklist ensures that our designs are consistent, accessible, and optimized for developer handoff.

## Visual design checklist

- Ensure spacing is consistent and matches the 8pt grid system
- Ensure text, colors and other styles match and use existing styles in Wildcard, if possible.
  - If adding new styles, ensure that they meet our [accessibility standards](./design-and-interaction-guidelines.md#accessibility-standards) and add them to Wildcard
- Review designs for accessibility:
  - Color blindness check
  - Contrast check should meet AA standard for small text
- Create dark mode compositions, if there are not existing dark mode designs in Wildcard
- Consider preparing redlines or an interaction delivery writeup for the following:
  - Margin and padding
  - Animation
  - Keyboard behavior
- Provide mockups to support the responsive behaviour. Even though the number of mobile and tablet visitors is relatively low, resizing the browser window to 1/2 and 1/3 width is a common use case. In addition, our objective is to provide a fully responsive platform. Note that there is no need to create a responsive version of every mockup. It's enough to include selected layouts that may be challenging to translate to smaller screen sizes.
  - If responsive behavior is an important consideration to your designs, describe expected behavior of layout for tablet and mobile screensizes

## User experience considerations

Improvements to the Sourcegraph user experience should consider the following in every change:

- Light mode / Dark mode
- Enterprise / Cloud
- Signed in vs. anonymous user
- User permissions and security
- Interactive mode / plain text mode
- Has the changeâ€™s effect on the CLI been considered?
  - Does the language in the UI map to the language in the CLI?
  - Does the documentation reflect the change?
