# Product

Product at Sourcegraph consists of [product management](product_management/index.md), [product design](design/index.md), and [technical writing](technical_writing/index.md). Each of these links will take you to a page with information on how that team works internally; this page contains information that is relevant to the whole company.

The Product team strives to make the following true:

- The team is working on the most important things to execute on [our strategy](../company/strategy/index.md), and that this is communicated well to teammates and everyone outside of sourcegraph.
- Each teammate has the customer and product context needed (about customer problems, likely future priorities, possible solutions, etc.) to perform their work effectively.

## Contact

You can reach us at the #product channel or @product-team on Slack. If you have ideas you want to pass on to the product team, check out the [surfacing product feedback](surfacing_product_feedback.md) page.

## Roadmap & Strategy

The public strategy containing our mission, vision, how we think about prioritization, and what we're working on next can be found on the [Sourcegraph strategy page](../company/strategy/index.md).

There is also a [PMM roadmap deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o3R8WUIhzzRz0x5laTwVcizOzVWrMBe5MCAz74H45Ss/edit#slide=id.gf131fe1596_2_7) (internal only) deck which contains upcoming and recently launched important customer-facing features from the OKR and roadmap tracker, and a [key accounts deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18hw513mX3ssA9isQdGdnmrt5-BIN4TRMpjkSaodTEuw/edit#slide=id.gf03521df2b_0_0) (internal only) which contains status information on key accounts.

## Product team and feature matrices

## Product team initiatives

Occasionally the product team takes on special initiatives that are not strictly tied to product delivery. Those are tracked here.

### Product led metrics refinement

In an effort to gain more clarity around product success and growth on Cloud, we aim to iterate and decide on the current Sourcegraph user metric definitions for On Premise. Targeting to have the new definition in place in FY21 Q3.

- CE / Product communication and prioritization improvements on feedback

In the meantime, we are using a [tracking document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezjeAV2wnUKfXQjHE-Cy9eZ7i4HX2mty1zuE4VcGGGo/edit#) for these.
