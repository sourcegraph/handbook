# Product

Product at Sourcegraph consists of [product management](product_management/index.md), [product design](design/index.md), and [technical writing](technical_writing/index.md). Each of these links will take you to a page with information on how that team works internally; this page contains information that is relevant to the whole company.

The Product team strives to make the following true:

- The team is working on the most important things to execute on [our strategy](../company/strategy/index.md), and that this is communicated well to teammates and everyone outside of sourcegraph.
- Each teammate has the customer and product context needed (about customer problems, likely future priorities, possible solutions, etc.) to perform their work effectively.

## Contact

You can reach us at the #product channel or @product-team on Slack. If you have ideas you want to pass on to the product team, check out the [surfacing product feedback](surfacing_product_feedback.md) page.

## Roadmap

The product strategy and what we're working on next can be found on the [Sourcegraph strategy page](../company/strategy/index.md). There is also an (internal only) [roadmap presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o3R8WUIhzzRz0x5laTwVcizOzVWrMBe5MCAz74H45Ss/edit#slide=id.gf131fe1596_2_7) available which highlights major features coming next as well as what was recently shipped.

## Feature Maturity

We have a page listing our [features and maturity levels](maturity.md).

## Metrics

- [User metrics definitions](../bizops/user_definitions.md)
- [How to add metrics](../bizops/analytics.md#How-to)

## Product team initiatives

Occasionally the product team takes on special initiatives that are not strictly tied to product delivery. Those are tracked here.

### Product led metrics refinement

In an effort to gain more clarity around product success and growth on Cloud, we aim to iterate and decide on the current Sourcegraph user metric definitions for On Premise. Targeting to have the new definition in place in FY21 Q3.

### Public facing roadmap

We are missing a single source of truth for what is currently on the roadmap. Our customers as well as Sales, Customer Engineering, Customer Support, and Marketing all need to know what is on the roadmap. Today we use several methods to track our roadmap making any one source unreliable. The end goal is to have a single source of truth that is referenced as needed.

### Defining our product maturity

Customer Engineering is looking to better undrestand the known boundaries of our product to effectively interact with prospetive customers. As a product team we are pulling together information of existing customer scale. This information combined with our product knowledge will help us proactively set expectations.

### Other initiatives

There are a few other initiatives we will be tracking here soon:

- CE / Product communication and prioritization improvements on feedback
- Experimentation and improvements to planning
- Consolidation and simplification of tooling

In the meantime, we are using a [tracking document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezjeAV2wnUKfXQjHE-Cy9eZ7i4HX2mty1zuE4VcGGGo/edit#) for these.
