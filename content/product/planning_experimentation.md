# Experimentation and improvements to planning

## Experiments with the AARRR Framework

Features are no different than products in their need to aquire visitors, activeate users, retain those users, expand via referal and other viral means and generate revenue for the business.  

To improve planning so that teams consider these stages as part of feature developement, some product teams are experimenting with Dave McClure's pirate framework. This framework condenses these phases into an easy to remember (if not comical sounding) mnemonic:


- Aquisition  - grow the number of users using the feature
- Activation - improve the number of users who see value
- Retention - ensure activiated users come back to the feature
- Referral - ensure your users invite other users
- Revenue - understand how the feature contributes back to the business. 

Learn more about the framework with this well written [introduction](https://medium.com/@ginoarendsz/an-introduction-to-the-aarrr-framework-b8570d6ae0d2) or Dave McClure's [slide deck on the topic](https://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version).

To leverage the framework, teams are incorporing the metrics in [product documents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-TIKwwQd2eQEH0PCuBhOitLcm31Pdx5NmCShVj6JqyU/edit#bookmark=id.gp24i8rlesx), [user stories](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ltNMJnI=/) and in reporting such as [Amplitude notebooks](https://analytics.amplitude.com/sourcegraph/notebook/h7td539?source=sidebar).
