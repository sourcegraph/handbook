# The Network

## Sourcegraph Preferred Vendor Network (aka The Network)

We have a list of approved or contracted vendors + agencies, some we have in the system and some we don’t, but can reach out to for intros, scopes, or estimates. All of these vendors and freelancers have been vetted by the Brand team or are a direct referral from an internal employee. We will scrub this list each year and remove/hide agencies we’d prefer to sunset moving forward. If for any reason our team is unable to support individual requests for creative (either directly or indirectly), we will happily facilitate an introduction to a recommended and trusted vendor to ensure that your project is attended to with the utmost care and quality.

## About the Network
Though our permanent full-time team may be smaller, we can pull in experts, specialists, and extra help when needed to quickly and dramatically scale the volume and scope of the work we do by maintaining relationships with the best in the business in various fields, such as video production, storytelling, social, community, UX, and design. The vendors from our network flow in and out of our team as needed, and disperse when appropriate, in order to efficiently manage the ebbs and flow of business needs with little to no service disruption.
