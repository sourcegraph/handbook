# Developer Education

At Sourcegraph, we want to make it so everyone can code — not just ~0.1% of the world population — so that we can see faster and more broadly beneficial technological progress. The Developer Education team will be collaborating across the organization to empower developers and support their growth.

## Mission and vision

The Developer Education team is dedicated to Sourcegraph’s long-term mission of supporting everyone in being able to code. Increased technical literacy will enable the creation of more innovative technology and ensure that technology is benefiting _all_ communities. The Developer Education team will serve developers, student developers (and their teachers), open source contributors, and teams of developers. We will deliver approachable, high-quality learning resources that address a variety of open source and Sourcegraph topics.
