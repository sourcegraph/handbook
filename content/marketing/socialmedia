# Social Media

The social media team at Sourcegraph is responsible for the management of brand channels, shaping a solid social media strategy, and contributing to positive brand sentiment, and fostering awareness. 

The social media manager also plays an integral role in helping our values-driven and all-remote team members to get active on social. That means developing personal brand guidelines in addition to Sourcegraph’s brand guidelines. 

## How to contact your Social Media Manager

There are so many folks contributing to [Marketing](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/marketing#who-to-go-to-for-what) @ Sourcegraph. But if you want to contact the Social Media Team, we recommend you star or join these channels in Slack: 

#social-media-action channel: Send urgent social media related requests, questions, or industry updates to this channel. If you need something that requires an action to be taken- you’re in the right place. 

#social-media-posts: In spirit of being open and transparent, you can use this channel to see Sourcegraph social media posts that have published. 

## Shaping Social @ Sourcegraph

Social @ Sourcegraph to date has not had a formal strategy when it comes to the social media content, reporting, or campaigns. So it is important to note that this will be a year full of experimentation, learning, and testing. The Social Media Team aims to create a more strategic, effective, and streamlined presence on social to increase brand awareness, and follower and engagement growth. It is our mission to grow the code search and Sourcegraph conversations. 

Organic social promotion is sought after by many teams, programs, and campaigns so it is important to create an understanding that Social @ Sourcegraph has its own goals and tactics. We will take requests from other teams but understand that:

* We do not participate in direct marketing.
* Our social interactions put our community, and the wider developer community- first.
* We celebrate milestones, and contributions shared by team members and Sourcegraph users.
* Organic social is a top-of-funnel activity driving impressions, engagements, conversations and link clicks. What we share should move users further down the funnel. But the next team needs to pick up the conversion. 
* We enable and amplify our developer advocates, always. They are evangelizing code search. A connection is felt to be stronger, and more authentic when conversation is between humans, not a brand. So we lean on the personal presence of our advocates first. And amplify those interactions when we see fit.

##  Brand Social Channels

These channels are owned and operated by Sourcegraph as a company in the care of the Social Media Team under the Brand umbrella. They provide the company a mix of audiences and content opportunities. And sometimes the goals may differ depending on what we are trying to accomplish at a given moment.

[Twitter] (https://twitter.com/sourcegraph)
[LinkedIn] (https://www.linkedin.com/company/sourcegraph/)

[Twitch] (https://www.twitch.tv/sourcegraph) and [YouTube] (https://www.youtube.com/c/sourcegraph) are a testament to building community. Community enthusiasts stream live on these platforms. And then the brand channels promote events like Dev Tool Time and the Sourcegraph podcast. 

Although these channels have the company name as part of the profile page, they serve different purposes for us in our social media landscape. The core social media team will only partner with those who produce the content. The social media team can provide metrics of success. We can also amplify to expand the reach of this content. But the social media team will never actually produce the live streams. These are left to our developer advocates, team members, etc. 

## Personal Social Channels

Guidelines COMING SOON!

The power of 1 profile has much less impact than the power of many. That’s pretty obvious, we know. 

It is important to express that Social @ Sourcegraph encompasses brand, team member, and community social channels. Through brand and team member personalities, we will become a relatable brand with a strong connection to our community. 

The Social Media team is responsible for enabling team members to supplement their personal channels. We do not have a formal Employee Advocacy tool. So this section will provide tips on how to set your profile up for success, how to curate content, and how to engage like an expert online. 

It is critical that Sourcegraph team members understand that there is a separation between themselves/their voices and beliefs and the brand. The brand has a particular voice, personality, and set of values.

## Shortening URLs

The social media team is often asked to shorten URLs for team members. [You can learn more about that here.] (https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/communication#shortening-urls) 

## Social during an incident

The social media manager has the authority to use Sourcegraph’s high agency value when globally felt events occur, or when an unplanned event causes a service disruption.

That said, the social media team may pause all brand channel social posts at a given moment. This practice is called “going dark” and we will use this strategy to avoid our brand flooding social media feeds during a given time. 

When this practice is being used, all scheduled posts will be moved to drafts. The social media manager will review drafts and assess if the social copy feels relevant, or not. Time-sensitive posts will be rescheduled first. We also have the agency to determine if a particular post will not be rescheduled. It is possible social copy may need to be updated depending on the cultural impact.
