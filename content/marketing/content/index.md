# Content marketing

At Sourcegraph, we define **content marketing** as generating awareness, building trust, and nurturing our relationship with the developer community and enterprise buyers by providing interesting, relevant, and valuable content. This definition explains why we create content and who we create it for.

**Content strategy** dives a layer deeper to include the governance and operations of content: how we generate, validate, and approve ideas; how we ensure quality and consistency; where we distribute content; how we measure performance; and how we update, revise, and retire content.

## Purpose, mission, and vision

Our purpose, mission, and vision explain why we create, who we create it for, and what we strive to achieve.

**Purpose:** Inspire and advocate for better developer experiences.

**Mission:** Educate the market on the risks of poor developer experiences (ex: Big Code) and the benefits of effective development environments (ex: universal code search).

**Vision:** Become the most trusted branded resource
covering the developer experience.

## Content principles

These are the principles that guide all content creation at Sourcegraph.

1. **Quality over quantity.** We do not sacrifice quality for quantity, and we take our reputation as a content producing company seriously. We respect our audiences’ time and thus, we respect the creative process and allow ample time for content creation.
1. **Audience-first mentality.** We prioritize the needs of our audience over our own. Our content offers useful and actionable information regardless of whether the reader uses Sourcegraph or not. Content marketing does not equal advertising.
1. **Keep it helpful and simple.** We make it easy to find, consume, and share our content. We create content that is intelligent, thoughtful, and accessible to all and apply user experience best practices. We don’t engage in fear mongering or share vapid content.

### Values alignment

| Be customer driven   | Our content serves our customers’ interests first. We focus on providing valuable information to our audiences over pitching or selling our product.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Work as a team       | We welcome and support contributions from across our company and community and respect diverse perspectives. We create content processes that enable anyone to contribute in a meaningful way while reserving the right to disagree and commit.                                                                              |
| High agency          | We meet our deadlines and communicate risks well in advance. All of our editorial processes are documented in the handbook and if something is broken, we fix it. Anyone can advocate for their content idea by writing a pitch or proposal.                                                                                 |
| High quality         | All public-facing content requires an editorial review (peer and/or editor depending on the content type) and adheres to our internal approval processes. We promise to keep content and editorial processes agile and low friction. We reserve the right to pull content that does not meet our documented brand standards. |
| Be a good human      | Our content is rooted in empathy for our audiences. We strive to be relatable and show care for the people we speak to. We never engage in slander or defamation of another person, product, company, or service.                                                                                                            |
| Open and transparent | Our content strategies, plans, and tactics are open and accessible to everyone in the company. We create editorial processes that make it easy to see and understand what content is planned, in progress, published, and how it’s performing.                                                                               |
| Continuously grow    | We actively solicit feedback and use data to improve the quality of our content. We experiment with new content ideas by writing proposals and reporting on our findings.                                                                                                                                                    |
