# Blog Hackathon

- Save the date: 2021-08-25
- Slack channel: #blog-hackathon

Block your calendars! The Content team invites team members from our Engineering, Product, Customer Support, and Customer Engineering orgs to take part in our first Blog Hackathon. 

This is a day dedicated to writing for the blog. If you've always wanted to contribute to the Sourcegraph blog but weren't sure where to start/couldn't make the time, the Blog Hackathon is for you!

## How it works

### What to expect on the day

Please join #blog-hackathon on Slack, where we will share updates throughout the day. 

- Feel free to brainstorm ideas and ask any questions in the Slack channel
- We will open a Zoom room for people to drop in, hang out, and get advice or feedback on your ideas and drafts
- We will be awarding spot prizes throughout the day

### Getting started

You can take part in the hackathon in a few ways:

1. Submit a blog post for publishing on the Sourcegraph blog
1. Contribute to a crowd-sourced blog post (more on this to come!)
1. Help with peer reviews of other team members' submissions

#### What to write about

As with everything we do, [be customer driven](../../company/values.md##be-customer-driven). When choosing a topic, consider whether our core audience of developers would be interested in it. If you're a developer, would you click on this post if you saw it on Hacker News?

Our [Editorial handbook also has some ideas and inspiration](editorial.md#what-to-write-about-for-the-sourcegraph-blog) to help you get started. 

### Submitting

Don't worry—you don't need to finish your submission on the day and we won't publish anything until you're ready. 

- You will have until the end of the following week (2021-09-06) to submit your complete draft. 
- Please have a peer review your draft before you submit it.
- You can submit in a Google Doc or PR. Please @ mention Rebecca Dodd (@rebeccadee on GitHub) to make sure your submission is counted.  

### Publishing

- We will review your submissions as soon as possible and may have feedback for you to address before publishing.
- Depending on how many submissions we receive, there may be a delay before we publish your post. It's better for us to stagger publishing so we don't overwhelm our potential readers with too much at once. 
- If your submission is time sensitive (for example, it relates to a product release or community event) please let us know when you submit. 

## Incentives and rewards
