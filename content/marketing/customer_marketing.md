# Customer marketing

## What is customer marketing
Customer marketing collaborates with marketing, sales, customer engineering, and product teams to tell compelling customer stories and run customer programs, like our Customer Advisory Board, that create value for developers and Sourcegraph. 

## Which customers can we publicly reference? 
We don't have permission to publicly reference all of our customers. A good rule of thumb is to only reference customers you see on the [about site](https://about.sourcegraph.com/). If you have questions about a specific customer, feel free to ask in #marketing.

Keep in mind, this applies to personal posts on Twitter or LinkedIn. 

## How can you collaborate with customer marketing?
We're always looking to share how our customers use Sourcegraph. If there's a customer story you'd like to tell, submit a request [here](https://form.asana.com?k=hNaq42PNshdQ1FjjEUKjLA&d=7195383522959).
