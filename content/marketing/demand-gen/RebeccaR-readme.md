# Rebecca Rissinger README

### My view on demand generation
 
Demand Generation is a collaboration between marketing and sales where you support one another. There's an open line of communication so we can each do our jobs to the best possible capacity. Wins should be celebrated across the organization together!
 
### Preferred learning styles
 
I'm a lifelong, curious learner. With that, I ask many questions and love getting hands-on to rip things apart and put them back together.
 
### Communication style
 
Working at an async company can be challenging for me from time to time. Being someone that thinks through things technically, I'm used to having direct conversations with people to get to the bottom of why something is the way it is. Sometimes I struggle when it comes to written communication because I often worry that I'm not expressing myself in the best way possible.
 
### How I manage my calendar
 
As a mom, I do the best I can. I'm available for meetings from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm EST. If I have to shift my schedule around, I do the best to communicate that and hop on earlier in the am or later in the evening to get things done.
 
### Preferred way to collaborate
 
I'm down to write RFCs, but sometimes I think it's more efficient to have a quick convo and hash out the task at hand. I'm into a good weekly sync, but I'm also open to pings on slack to answer quick questions!
 
### How I approach problems
 
I tackle things head-on. I like to understand the who/what/why and then dive in.
 
### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated
 
A thank you goes a long way for me! It's always nice to have people tell me others think I'm doing a good job.
 
### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help
 
If you need help, just ask! I'll do the best I can do to solve the problem, and when I don't know how to fix something, I'll transparently admit it and help you figure out who is best to help!
 
### What I find enjoyable at work
 
My best days at work are when I can solve a big problem or run through a bunch of things on my TODO list.
 
### How do I feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for me to see and respond to during active hours
 
I'm not great at setting boundaries, but I do try to prioritize the importance of things. It depends on what the message is about. If I think it's critical to accomplish at that moment, I'll hop in and roll up my sleeves.
 
### How folks can best show up for me when I seem off
 
Listen to me if I'm in need of an ear, tell me we're in this together, and then help come up with a solution to whatever problem is going on at the moment!
 
### Things I am aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work
 
Feeling alone, conflict, learning new things in a crunch.
 
### Marketing areas of knowledge
 
Marketing technologies, tracking marketing metrics, managing stellar teams.
 
### Marketing areas of interest to learn
 
I'm always learning by reading articles and listening to podcasts on how to be a better product lead growth marketer. (As someone that comes with a traditional marketing funnel background, this is something that's still a WIP for me.)
 
### Current personal project
 
Raising my son!
 
### Something I fear
 
I fear failure.
 
### A quote I like
 
All you need is love.
 
--The Beatles
 
### How I eat fries
 
Ranch, blue cheese, ketchup, or honey mustard are all appropriate dressings for me! I typically grab a cluster of fries and dip them all at once to be efficient.
 
### My sun, moon, and rising signs
 
I'm a Gemini. All the things they say about us are trueâ€¦ at least for me.
