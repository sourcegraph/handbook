### Individual view on demand generation

I’m all-in on creating phenomenal digital experiences worth showing up and sticking around for. [Sarah’s README](./sarah-readme.md) said “When I talk about demand here, I’m talking about the economic principle which refers to a person’s desire to purchase and willingness to pay, ideally, a premium. Demand is created with positioning, imagery, contexts, language. It’s all about the vibe, y’know?” \
 \
From a digital perspective, this starts with ensuring when I drive someone from a campaign to our website, we’re about to deliver an experience that delights and adds value, regardless of where they go. Cultivating a digital experience worth returning to takes time, constant attention, and optimization. Something many marketers overlook when it comes to demand generation is what we aren’t doing is just as important as what we are doing. From a digital vantage point, I’m also searching for the moments we’re unintentionally creating friction for our buyers, eroding the demand we’re working so hard to generate.

### Preferred learning styles

Tell me, then show me. +1 to repetitive observation with clarifying questions. I love a clarifying question.

### Communication style

I might be one of the first to speak in a meeting, but that’s mostly a relic of a time when not speaking first meant I may be heading off in a nonsensical direction, and being one of the first to share a strategic POV could often add additional context to a conversation that could help course correct. With that said, some notes on my communication style.

- If you’ve read anything about enneagram 5s and how they communicate, it’s me ✨
- I won’t commit to things I’m not sure of and you probably won’t find me musing about incomplete theories aloud without first doing some light research
- I might spend ages working on a response to something you’ve sent in Slack, but it’ll be thoughtful and full of detail
- Sometimes I’ll 👀 a message to acknowledge that I’ve seen it but don’t have time to draft an answer right now, but sometimes it just means I’m intrigued by what’s happening in the thread and following along with others. Interpret as you wish.
- Please don’t impromptu Slack call me. I’m often down for quick, informal video calls but appreciate a heads up first

### How I manage my calendar

You’ll find me online Monday–Thursday, 7 am–6 pm PT (that’s 10 am–9 pm ET for my East Coast friends or 2 pm–1 am UTC if that’s your thing). As a general rule, I’m good for morning meetings from 8am PT on. If you need to meet earlier, send me a Slack! \
 \
I could easily sit down at my desk in the morning and lose myself in work, not getting back up for HOURS if I don’t make an intentional effort to go do something during the day. I try to hold time midday to get offline at least for an hour between 11 am-2 pm PT so if you’re trying to find time to meet with me, that’s probably not the move. For my West Coast friends, I’m online till 6 pm PT most days and happy to meet in the afternoons/evening if necessary.

### Preferred way to collaborate

I appreciate context, so a thoughtful RFC is my jam. At the same time, I’m always down to help you brainstorm a fresh idea or screenshare and work through a problem together...just know that I’ll rarely default to being the on-screen notetaker or volunteer myself to type while screensharing. \
 \
Typing with an audience makes me anxious (lol, keep reading, you’ll understand) and when I get anxious my hands go numb, and when my fingers go numb, I start making typos and proceed to get more anxious about my ability to type, and well….you get the idea.

### How you approach problems

Thoughtfully and thoroughly! All the steps, in order, no skipsies.

### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

I think words of affirmation are big for me, but being the center of attention in large group settings invokes anxiety so do with that what you will.

### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

I gotta own that I am not. good. at. this. Asking for help personally often feels like a failure to me. Not only is this distorted thinking unhelpful, but also one of my favorite things to do at work is using my experience to help others. A day where I get to teach someone something that’ll make their day-to-day a little easier is a win for me, regardless of how closely related it is to my “job” description.

### What you find enjoyable at work

Solving complex problems with brilliant people. Love, love, love something like looking at the entire user journey, zeroing in on a specific issue and digging into data to solve it, and then zooming back out to measure the impact on the overall journey. Rinse and repeat.

One of my favorite parts of digital marketing is the blend of creativity and analytical thinking it takes to be successful. If I think about the most rewarding moments of my career, there are so many times I got to look at my teammates and say “Did you see that integration/campaign/website/landing page/[name-your-marketing-thing] function exactly as intended?! No unexpected errors or surprises? AND sales promptly followed-up?!” It’s a beautiful thing when everything comes together after taking the time to identify a specific issue or a tool that no longer serves you and then spending months rearchitecting it.

### What kind of work do you find easiest to do when

I do some of my most focused work in the early mornings (if I don’t open Slack) and mid-afternoon through the evening, once our friends on the East Coast are offline for the day.

### How do you feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for you to see and respond to during active hours

Go for it! I’m a recovering people pleaser so I typically default to adapting to others’ communication preferences to make things convenient for others, but I usually won’t respond if it interferes with my personal boundaries with work (with the exception of emergencies, of course).

### How folks can best show up for us when we seem off (give space, ask if work is the right place for us to be today, etc)

You can ask what’s up if I seem off! I’ve been told I have an expressive face, so don’t be surprised if I’m just puzzling out a complex problem and happen to look displeased. Other things people have told me: I’ve got some workaholic tendencies (oops) and can certainly disappear into work. If it seems like someone should check me, I truly welcome a gentle call-out that perhaps work isn’t the spot for me today. Sometimes we all need a lil encouragement to face the real world, ya know?

### Things you are aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

Not knowing things or not having the full context, and not feeling like an expert in areas I feel I “should” have domain expertise. Being forced to make decisions on the spot. I’m a true enneagram 5 in every sense.

### Marketing areas of knowledge

SEO, SEM, digital strategy, digital consumer behavior, conversion optimiaztion (website & campaigns)

### Marketing areas of interest to learn

UX &lt; I know that’s not 100% marketing, but my curiosity with UX began with observing how UX principles influence everything from the campaigns we run to how a user behaves on our website

### Current personal project

Have I mentioned I’m 1/3 of a book club podcast? It’s a lot of work and a lot of fun. When my work boundaries get a little lax, this is where it’s felt the most. I’m working on being more intentional about my boundaries for that very reason and we’re testing some new ways of working (hello, 4-day schedule).

I know I’m a Leo, and that I’ve been meaning to find my birth certificate and download Costar for a minute now so I can figure out the rest and play along, but alas, here we are.
