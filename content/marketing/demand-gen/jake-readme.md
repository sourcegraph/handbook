### My view on demand generation

Demand generation can be one of the most rewarding careers! When I think about how I want to share a new product or give something away, I always think about how I feel when being marketed to. The short answer? I don't like to be marketed to. What I do love is when someone takes the time to connect with me and personalize my marketing experience. Everyone is different and one approach for all just doesn't work. 

### Preferred learning styles

Learning by doing! 

### Communication style

I tend to lean towards in-person (or video chat) rather than sending a bunch of messages. 

### Preferred way to collaborate

Just like Shakespeare and his band of players, I love to send out the script early so everyone can review. From here, a formal meeting to make sure we're aligned. The rest is rooted in everyone learning their own parts and supporting each other, adjusting the lines, and finally prep for opening night with a big cast check in. We're in it together and it takes everyone to do it right.

### How I approach problems

- Define the problem to understand it and how big it is
- Get the right minds on the case
- Brainstorm ways to overcome it
- Identify the poor options vs. best solutions
- Put ideation into action
- Review and iterate
- Celebrate with a glass of Cakebread Cellars 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon

### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

It's nice to be recognized when you've put in the work, but some people struggle with celebration and I'm one of those unfortunates. 

### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

This is when real work happens! We can't possibly accomplish everything on our own and we really miss out when we don't ask for help. I've found that a lot of my most memorable marketing activites and successes came from asking someone else to help out. 

### What I find enjoyable at work

I have a few things I really love most:
- Strategizing on a new idea or creative campaign with others
- The after a big conference and event after leads are submitted and there is a moment to breathe
- Turning my favorite tunes up and doing some creative copy writing
- A morning with no meetings and a hot cup of coffee while I peruse through emails and daily to-dos

### What kind of work do I find easiest to do

Organizing and build process docs. This is who I've become and I fully accept this about my life.

### How do I feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for me to see and respond to during active hours

While I'm at a conference, field event, or team offsite this is a normal occurance. Otherwise, I typically avoid it because I like to keep my work boundaries balanced. I've found this to be more common in our new WFH environments when teams are distributed. 

### How folks can best show up for me when I seem off

I tend to prefer honesty instead of beating around the bush, but I also have a very dry sense of humor. A little humor can go a long ways.

### Things I am aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

If a leader writes something very vague like "We need to chat" or "I have to talk to you about something." 99% of the time, it's nothing at all, but anxiety sure loves to blow things out of proportion.

### How I eat fries

With way too much ketchup!

### My sun, moon, and rising signs

I'm not sure, but I think I'm a libra.
