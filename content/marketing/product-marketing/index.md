## Team vision and principles

- We have a collaborative, efficient, and repeatable motion for bringing new features and products to market.
- We are a strategic partner for Product, Sales, and Marketing. We do our best work when we’re brought in early.
- We communicate the value of our products and focus on both the “what” and the “why.”
- We align our team goals with the broader company goals and our work contributes to both revenue and adoption.
- We are advocates for our customers. We launch products and make decisions with our customers in mind.

## What we do

Tactically, here are the activities Product Marketing will drive and contribute to. This list is not exhaustive and is flexible - there will certainly be times when other teams drive these initiatives.

## Working with other teams

| **Team**                | **Where PMM can add value**                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **How we collaborate**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Product/Engineering** | Product roadmap planning and prioritization, bringing new products to market, pricing and packaging, naming, conducting primary and secondary research, product copy, collaborating on content (blog posts, webinars, etc.)            | PMM will be better able to support feature/product launches and influence the product roadmap with early involvement.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Sales/CE**            | Messaging and positioning, use cases and value drivers, buyer personas, creating external collateral (pitch decks, one sheeters, case studies), product training, competitive intelligence, synthesizing and sharing customer feedback | PMM primarily focuses on “one:many” communication, whereas Sales/CE primarily focus on “one:one” communication. There may be times that PMM is brought in to support a strategic customer or prospect, but the team is not big enough to support every deal. |
| **Marketing**           | Messaging and positioning, buyer personas, content development and review, subject matter expertise, marketing campaigns and programs                                                                                                  | Given that many members of the marketing team are relatively new, we’ll figure this out together as we work on key initiatives that span across the entire marketing org.                                                                                    |
