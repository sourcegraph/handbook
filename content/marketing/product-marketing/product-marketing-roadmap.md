# Product marketing roadmap

## What is the product marketing roadmap?

Sourcegraph's Product and Product Marketing teams collaborated on building a [roadmap deck that communicates rolling releases in a 6-month outlook](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o3R8WUIhzzRz0x5laTwVcizOzVWrMBe5MCAz74H45Ss/edit?usp=sharing). The product marketing roadmap is available for Sourcegraph team members and covers the new product releases that are coming in the foreseeable future, as well as the value each provides to Sourcegaph customers. In essence, the product marketing roadmap provides a higher-level perspective for customers on the big problems Souregraph is solving and why and as such, it potentially doesn't cover every specific release Sourcegraph is working on.

[Sourcegraph Product teams' direction pages](../../direction/index.md#per-area-direction-pages) are a public, detailed resource. These pages outline individual product areas' goals and roadmaps that are aligned to the company OKRs, Sourcegraph direction, and overall product strategy.

## Will this product marketing roadmap deck be updated?

The product marketing roadmap outlines rolling releases and is designed to capture a ~6-month time period. This asset will be updated periodically to reflect our future product directions (e.g., it will outline a new feature) and also could be updated with changes to existing information (e.g., updated to capture that a Beta release date is changing). We will outline the changes made in the deck for the sake of transpranecy, so everyone could be aware of the full context when using the deck at any point in time.

## What resources do I have at my disposal when it comes to the product roadmap?

[The product marketing roadmap deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o3R8WUIhzzRz0x5laTwVcizOzVWrMBe5MCAz74H45Ss/edit?usp=sharing) is the one resource and reference that Sourcegraph team members (e.g., Sales, CEs, etc.) should use when discussing the company's product roadmap with customers.
Furthermore, we put together collateral to introduce internal teams to the product marketing roadmap deck:

- [Context slides on what you can expect from the roadmap deck and tips for presenting it to customers](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xPfhqg_5bCbN1MSQQ-J8zioSDz2TO71SK2fY1RtBBRw/edit?usp=sharing).
- [An on-demand recorded training walking you through these best practices and the roadmap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18upBf9KWfNitNVC4syi2ffBmG_-_vQR-/view?usp=sharing) (Recorded on September 25, 2021).
