## Definitions

### Customer

A customer is an organization with a Sourcegraph subscription contract that has not ended.

1. We can only publicly mention the names of customers who have explicitly agreed to be referenceable.
   - Customers mentioned on [about.sourcegraph.com](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) (by logo and/or case study) are referenceable.
   - If in doubt about whether another customer is referenceable by name, ask in #sales.
1. If an organization's contract will start in the future, they are still considered a customer. (This can happen when we agree to have a contract start on the next 1st of the month because that makes life easier for a customer, for example.)

### Sales Accepted Opportunity (SAO)

Sales Accepted Opportunities are where ALL of the following are true:

- We have completed an intro call/meeting with the company/contact
- Company/contact has expressed some form of interest/need in Sourcegraph
- Contact can be a potential champion or coach
- Company has >50 Developers **OR** Company is a Commercial account ( <250 employees)
- We have next steps

Any Opportunity that is moved into the Qualification Stage or beyond is automatically tagged as Sales Accepted Opportunity in Salesforce

### Multiple Sales Accepted Opportunities (SAOs) within the same account:

It is acceptable to create multiple opportunities within the same account. SDR crediting will apply under the following circumstances:

- The new SAO has a new Primary Contact
- The new Primary Contact was not referred by an existing Primary Contact
- There have been no Closed Won opportunities within the past 30 days
- All SAO criteria is met for the newly created opportunity

### Target Opportunity Profile:

SDRs should focus on identifying and setting meetings for the AE team that meet the following criteria:

Relevant contact (potential champion or coach) that is aware of / understands code search in some capacity (has used Sourcegraph or another code search tool like OpenGrok, has worked for Google/Facebook and used their tool)

OR

Title/role includes developer productivity, developer experience, API services, distinguished eng, platform engineer, director+ eng

AND

Company has 50+ devs **OR** Company is a Commercial account ( <250 employees)

### Target Account

Target Accounts are prospective customer accounts that the AE/SDR has specifically identified as priority accounts for outbound prospecting efforts.

Target Accounts can be easily identified in Salesforce by the “Target Account” field designation. To make any updates to this field on a particular account, please contact your manager.

AE can trade a targeted account for an unassigned account with managers approval. Must be in writing and sent to the Manager.
If the Manager accepts trade/Account will be transferred to AE. AE’s SDR will be assigned automatically to account and should be notified of the change in ownership.

## Stages

See also the [MQL (marketing-qualified lead) definition](../marketing/index.md#mql).

See [Our Stages and the reasoning behind them.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z4LPeKmqCiIi92EchKBZMR8kVIGeTnOwhukYZCX2A0M/)

### Maintaining customer spreadsheets

Maintaining [Server Installers to Company List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y2Z23-2uAjgIEITqmR_tC368OLLbuz12dKjEl4CMINA/edit?usp=sharing) and [Server to Company List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wo_KQIcGrNGCWYKa6iHJ7MImJ_aI7GN12E-T21Es8TU/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheets for every new company on a trial and new customers.

These are used as join tables in Looker, and are important to connect instance data to a specific customer.
