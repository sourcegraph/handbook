# How and when to engage with security

### Security questionnaires

The CE team should take the first pass on inbound questionnaires using the [list of reference questionnaires](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11X8xoX9lK7aHY-UqZQIwQl_aQ8NQFu1D) we have collected in our shared drive.

Once the first pass is done, sign up for a security questionnaire review in [this signup sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6J8ZwPYDX-jJ0YU2l2CWXX3qboKD2XTbIeg5Q-NBAk/edit#).

For expedited reviews, contact [Dan Mckean](../company/team/index.md#dan-mckean).

> 💡 **Top Tip!** Add a search engine to Chrome to specifically search the folder of reference questionnaires.
>
> 1. Go into the Chrome settings
> 2. Go to "Managed Search Engines"
> 3. Add a new one
> 4. Name it "Search security questionnaires", give it shortcut you'll remember, and a URL of `https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=parent:11X8xoX9lK7aHY-UqZQIwQl_aQ8NQFu1D%20%s`
> 5. Open a new tab and type your shortcut, then a space, then the search term you want to find!

### Customer security questions

If customers have specific security questions, first run them by the #ce slack channel. If nobody has context, or we're unsure of how to phrase things, follow the [guidance here](../engineering/cloud/security/process.md#how-to-work-with-us) to engage with the Security team.
