## Customer Notes

Where to Store Customer Notes and Documents:

- Create Folder in the ['Customer Notes' Shared Folder Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gjXWQ1l0Fnt2pVS2ohx3w0cw-gaJ_Ez0)
- Naming Convention for Folder: "Customer/Prospect Name" - - then # customer or # prospect (see folder for examples)
- Within that folder, add all of your documents and notably, your running notes google document (which you'll link to the Salesforce opportunity in the designated field)
- If you'd like to save this folder into your own drive, that's simple and welcomed. Simply right click on the folder, then select 'Add Shortcut to Drive' - - then choose the preferred destination where you'd like this to land within your 'My Drive'

Note: Salesforce is the communication and document source of truth for our Sales Team. Upload all docs (contracts, etc) to Salesforce and the customer's folder in the [Custome contracts folder on GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ePvVWcZYdd1_3ZlCP5A0lvMbBhBCVfSm) as well.
