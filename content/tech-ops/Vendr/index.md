# Vendr: our procurement partner for all Saas software

## Vendr will serve two functions for us:

- A portal to store details about our Saas contracts (expiration dates, costs, contacts, etc)
- A trusted partner who will provide valuable insights into our Saas suppliers and ensure that we are getting the advantageous pricing and terms

## Why we teamed up with a procurement partner in 2021:

- Designated buyers (employees who are responsible for the spend) can better monitor contract end dates or renewal dates
- Renegotiations can commence in a timely manner, in advance of cessation or renewal
- The Company can increase visibility to current and anticipated spend on SaaS products
- Multi-year, multi-seat contracts are complicated and there are often hidden costs based on unforeseen situations and we needed input from experts on how to negotiate these types of deals

## What we hope to achieve through a partnership with Vendr:

- Cost savings of at least 36K in the first year (Sept 2021 - Sept 2022)
- Time back for system owners (time previously spent negotiating with vendors)
- Streamlined process for negotiated contracts
- Organization of existing and future contracts
- Future proofed multi-year contracts

## What will Vendr do for us:

- SaaS contract support
  - [Negotiations:](Supplier_Facing.md) A Vendr Executive Buyer negotiates on Sourcegraph’s behalf directly with the supplier. This includes routing contract components to Sourcegraph Legal, Security, and Finance for sign off
  - [Background support:](background_support.md) Vendr works with the Sourcegraph owner in the background to provide strategic guidance, supplier-specific insights, and positioning.
- [Renewal reminders](Renewals.md) (90 - 120 days before expiration)
- [Competitive market intelligence](Market_Intel.md)

## Who can use Vendr:

Anyone at Sourcegraph can submit an [intake form](Intake_Form.md).

[Procurement approval policies](../../finance/ap.md#sts=AP%20Policy) continue to apply but will also be routed for approval by Vendr further reducing your tasks when they handle the negotiations for us.
