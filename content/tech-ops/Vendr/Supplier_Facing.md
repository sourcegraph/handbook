#Vendr: Supplier-facing negotiations

A Vendr Executive Buyer negotiates this deal on Sourcegraph’s behalf directly with the supplier. This includes routing contract components to Sourcegraph Legal, Security, and Finance for sign-off.

What you will need to get started:

- You know you want to purchase this software and requirements are complete
- Budget approval
- You have a quote (which is over $5K)
- You have an account executive/contact at the supplier to provide to Vendr
- You have at least 15 business days prior to your deadline
- Vendr needs this much time to handle the negotiations and route to our Legal, Security, and Finance teams for approval and sign off of additional contract components

If you have all this then you can submit an [intake form](Intake_Form.md) through the portal.
