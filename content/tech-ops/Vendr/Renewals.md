# Renewals with Vendr

Vendr will automatically trigger an email asking the owner to submit an intake form for the upcoming renewal. These emails will be triggered 90-120 days before the renewal date. In the intake form you can request the Vendr handle the supplier-facing negotiations or provide background support.

Please check to make sure you review your tech stack in Vendr and ensure the correct renewal/expiration dates have been entered.
