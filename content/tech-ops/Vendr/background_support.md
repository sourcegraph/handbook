# Background Support

Vendr works with the Sourcegraph owner in the background to provide strategic guidance, supplier-specific insights, and positioning. An owner might leverage this option in the event that they want to:

- Keep the relationship between themselves and their account representative
- If they don’t have the 15 days required for Vendr to negotiate on their behalf
- Or they just want to run a negotiation by a Vendr buyer for their expertise opinion

What you will need to get started:

- At least 5 business days prior to your deadline if you want background support for your negotiation
- You have a quote (which is over $5K) and or terms that you want to share with Vendr

If you have this then you can submit an [intake form](Intake_Form.md) through the portal
