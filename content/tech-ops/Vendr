# Vendr: our procurement partner for all Saas software 

Vendr will serve two functions for us:
- A portal to store details about our Saas contracts (expiration dates, costs, contacts, etc)
- A trusted partner who will provide us valuable information about our existing and future suppliers and ensure that we are getting the advantageous pricing and terms

We hope that by partnering with Vendr we will be able to continue to encourage our teams to buy the systems they need while also providing visibility into our tech stack from a process and cost savings perspective.

Why we teamed up with a procurement partner in 2021:
- We didn’t have a lot of confidence around how to negotiate contracts 
- There was a lack of understanding about our current and anticipated spend on SaaS products
- Multi-year, multi-seat contracts are complicated and there are often hidden costs based on unforeseen situations and we needed input from experts on how to negotiate these types of deals

What we hope to achieve through a partnership with Vendr:
- Cost savings of at least 36K in the first year (Sept 2021 - Sept 2022)
- Time back for system owners (time previously spent negotiating with vendors)
- Streamlined process for negotiated contracts
- Organization of existing and future contracts
- Future proofed multi-year contracts

What will Vendr do for us:
- New SaaS contract support
  - **Negotiations**: A Vendr Executive Buyer negotiates this deal on Sourcegraph’s behalf directly with the supplier. This includes routing contract components to Sourcegraph Legal, Security, and Finance for sign off
- **Background support**: Vendr works with the Sourcegraph owner in the background to provide strategic guidance, supplier-specific insights, and positioning.
- **Renewal reminders** (90 - 120 days before expiration)
- **Competitive market intelligence**

Who can use Vendr:
Anyone at Sourcegraph can submit an **intake form**. [Procurement approval policies](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/finance/ap#approval-levels) continue to apply but will also be routed for approval by Vendr further reducing your tasks when they handle the negotiations for us.

What Vendr will not handle for us:
- Scoping requirements/needs
- Implementation
- Administration of software
- Purchases under $5K
- Canceling contracts with existing suppliers
- Non-SaaS purchases

When to reach out to Vendr:
- Ideally more than 15 business days before your deadline if you want Vendr to **negotiate the contract** OR at least 5 business days before your deadline for **background facing support**
- Purchasing new software over $5K 
- Upgrading mid-term with a significant jump in cost 
- Renewing an existing software (over $5K) that hasn’t yet been negotiated by Vendr
