# How to login & privileges

Everyone at Sourcegraph has the ability to log into Vendr through [Okta](../Okta.md). If you don’t see the title in your Okta portal you can request it via Self-Service or by contacting IT-Tech-Ops in Slack.

Sourcegraph accounts have two levels of permissions. Admin and Owner.

**Admins:** Tech Ops, Security, Legal, and Finance all have the ability to see every deal in the portal. This way they have access to all the documents, supplier information, and deal details. They can also add individual users to deals and suppliers in the event that an owner changes or you need visibility into an existing supplier or deal.

**Owners:** Owners can only see the details for the deals they have been tagged to or have submitted themselves.
