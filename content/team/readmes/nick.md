## 1-1s

I do weekly [1-1s](../../company-info-and-process/communication//1-1.md) with my direct reports. Add any topics that you want to dicuss to our [shared 1-1 notes Google Doc](../../company-info-and-process/communication/1-1.md#google-doc) and I will do the same.

## Getting to know you

If I am your new manager, I will setup a series of three extra 1-1s to learn more about you. Here are the prompts that I use:

1. Tell me about your life starting from grade school.
2. What do you want to do at the pinnacle of your career?
3. I will reflect back things I heard and tell you about how I think I can help you achieve your goals and be successful at Sourcegraph.

## Skip level 1-1s

A skip level 1-1 is between me and someone who I indirectly manage (e.g. the person reports to a person that I manage).

As our department continues to grow, I want to regularly check in with our teammates to keep a pulse on what is happening.

These 1-1s are intended to be casual and informal conversations to build deeper relationships, for me to listen, gather your feedback and insights, and discuss anything top of mind for you. These are not intended for status updates.

If you want to schedule some time to chat, feel free to send a calendar invite or message me on Slack.

If you receive a calendar invite from me but you need to change the date/time or you prefer not to meet, you can update the invite directly.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, questions, concerns, or anything else that you want me to know about, please don't hesitate to contact me directly by sending me a message via email or Slack, or by scheduling a time for us to video chat.
