## Management style

Work-wise I'm mostly a hands-off manager. I believe in hiring smart people, setting clear expectations, and then holding people accountable.
That said, I am always happy to get involved in the work when you need me.

I place a lot of emphasis on career development and personal growth with my direct reports. I believe if you are engaged and growing, not only will you be happy, but the team will benefit from it.

I use the [CliftonStrengths assessment](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths) to better understand your unique strengths so that I can help create the opportunities for you to utilize them.

## 1-1s

I do weekly [1-1s](../../leadership/1-1.md) with my direct reports.

## Skip-level meetings

I do skip-level meetings with all my indirect reports once a month.

## Getting to know you

If I am your new manager, I will ask you to schedule a series of three 60 minute 1-1s (1 per week, in addition to our regular 1-1) to learn more about you.

Here are the topics for the sessions:

1. Tell me about your life starting from grade school - include whatever you deem important to you.
2. What do you want to do at the pinnacle of your career?
3. I will reflect back things I heard and tell you about how I think I can help you achieve your goals and be successful at Sourcegraph.

_(Hat tip to [Nick Snyder](nick.md) who inspired me to follow his example)_

### For you

If you are my report you can expect me to give you both positive and constructive improvement feedback regularly. I aim to praise my reports in public (Slack channels, team sync/retrospective meetings), but constructive improvement feedback will always be in private.
