# Sourcegraph team

This page contains brief bios of our team. Teammates may also have a personal documentation page in this directory that is named according to their Sourcegraph email address(e.g.you@sourcegraph.com -> you.md).

Note that this page is driven by a data file, and clicking "Edit this page" in the bottom right corner of this page will not take you to the proper place to add or edit your bio. Instead, click "Edit team data" or [click here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/blob/main/data/team.yml) to be taken to the proper file. For more information, check out [these instructions](../handbook/editing/add-yourself-to-team-page.md).
