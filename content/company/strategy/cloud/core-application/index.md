# Core application goals and priorities

## Goals

### Private code on Sourcegraph Cloud

**Problem:** Customers who want to use Sourcegraph with their private code must setup and run a Sourcegraph instance on their own compute infrastructure. There are customers who want to use Sourcegraph but don't want to have to deploy and operate their own Sourcegraph instance and associated compute infrastructure. These customers expect to be able to search over only the code they care about, and are not inundated with public or irrelevant code. To host private code on Sourcegraph Cloud, we need to not only ensure the security of our product (which is important for on-premise deployments too), but we also have to ensure the security of our Sourcegraph Cloud infrastructure.

**Milestones:**

1. ✅ The Sourcegraph team members can add public code from GitHub.com and GitLab.com.
1. ✅ The Sourcegraph team members can add private code from Github.com and GitLab.com to Sourcegraph Cloud.
1. 🔄 Any user can add public code from GitHub.com and GitLab.com. ETA March 2021
1. 🔄 Any user can add private code from GitHub.com and GitLab.com. ETA April 2021
1. Marketing launch of private and public code for users on Sourcegraph Cloud. ETA May 2021
1. Sourcegraph Cloud is a viable alternative to Sourcegraph Server for a 20-100 person organization.
1. Sourcegraph Cloud is a paid product that is Generally Available (GA).
