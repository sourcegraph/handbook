## 1-1s

I do weekly [1-1s](../../leadership/1-1.md) with my direct reports. Add any topics that you want to dicuss to our [shared 1-1 notes Google Doc](../../leadership/1-1.md#google-doc) and I will do the same.

## Office hours

I hold monthly office hours on the 2nd Monday of the month, immediately following Company meeting. The purpose is to increase cross team collaboration and make myself available to everyone in the company that I might normally not get to interact with, and reduce having one-off meetings.

## Getting to know you

If I am your new manager, I will setup a series of three extra 1-1s to learn more about you. Here are the prompts that I use:

1. Tell me about your life starting from grade school.
2. What do you want to do at the pinnacle of your career?
3. I will reflect back things I heard and tell you about how I think I can help you achieve your goals and be successful at Sourcegraph.

## Skip level 1-1s

A skip level 1-1 is between me and someone who I indirectly manage (e.g. the person reports to a person that I manage).

If you would like to have a skip level 1-1 with me:

1. Find a time on my calendar that is open and send me a calendar invite.
2. Include as much context as is relevant so that I can prepare for the 1-1 if necessary.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, questions, concerns, or anything else that you want me to know about, please don't hesitate to contact me directly by sending me a message via email or Slack, or by scheduling a time for us to video chat.
