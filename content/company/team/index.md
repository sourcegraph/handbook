# Sourcegraph team

This page contains brief bios of our team. Teammates may also have a personal documentation page in this directory that is named according to their Sourcegraph email address(e.g.you@sourcegraph.com -> you.md).

Note that this page is driven by a data file, and clicking "Edit this page" in the bottom right corner of this page will not allow you to add or edit your bio. Edit [this file](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/blob/main/data/team.yml) to add yourself to the team page. For more information, check out [these instructions](../../handbook/editing/add-yourself-to-team-page.md).
