# Paying bills

## Limits

Generally, you should feel free to spend in ways that are in the best interest of the business (see our philosophy in [spending company money](spending-company-money.md)).

Specific categories of purchases that are listed on the [spending company money page](spending-company-money.md) (e.g. laptops, home office setup, etc.) do not need to follow the approval process below. They are pre-approved and can be [submitted for reimbursement](expenses.md) directly.

However, if you intend to make any other purchase that falls above the limits below, please refer to our [Company accounts payable policy](ap.md).

| Amount (Annual Equivalent) | Approval Required                                                                                 | Recommend Method of Payment              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| $0 - $1,000                | Does not require specific approval                                                                | Expensify / Remote.com / Brex / Bill.com |
| $1,000 to $10,000          | Needs to be approved by a director or above of your department                                    | Brex / Bill.com via Sourcegraph AP team  |
| $10,000 or greater         | Needs to be approved by a director or above of your department and Finance                        | Bill.com via Sourcegraph AP Team         |
| $50,000 or greater         | Needs to be approved by a director or above of your department, Finance, and the VP of Operations | Bill.com via Sourcegraph AP Team         |

## Corporate credit cards

Managers and above are eligible to receive corporate credit cards for team purchases. We use [Brex](https://brex.com), which allows you to receive a physical card, or to use a virtual card if desired.

Just [contact the finance team](index.md#contact) if you believe you are eligible for one and would like to have one. By default, the following monthly limits apply, but they can be raised if requested.

| Role                                       | Default monthly credit limit |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Department leads (VP-level or above)       | $10,000                      |
| Managers and Directors                     | $1,000                       |
| Analyst and Senior Analyst (with approval) | $500                         |

For corporate purchases on Brex cards (i.e. vendor payments) above $150, please provide receipts. For purchase of personal purchases above $50, (i.e. laptops, food, travel expenses), please upload a receipt. [Here](https://support.brex.com/how-do-i-attach-receipts-to-brex-transactions/) is guidance for the receipt upload process.

If you have a purchase that you’d like to explain/clarify post about it in the #finance Slack channel (e.g. if it's some new system for the team) or email `finance@sourcegraph.com` (e.g. if it's a personal reimbursable expense).

## Getting invoices paid

If you intend to make a purchase that will be paid by invoice (e.g., if it's too large to pay by credit card), send it to [ap@sourcegraph.com](mailto:ap@sourcegraph.com). The finance & accounting team will ask any questions as needed, and submit it for payment.

All vendors are required to provide a W-9 before payment can be made. It is the responsibilty of the purchaser to ensure this information is acquired.
