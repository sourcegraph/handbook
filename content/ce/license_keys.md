# Creating and maintaining license keys for customers

Sourcegraph requires site administrators to input a license key to have access to various [paid features](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing). This page explains how to create, use, and maintain license keys for prospects and customers.

Valid license keys can only be generated by site administrators on Sourcegraph.com.

License keys are created and managed on Sourcegraph.com in the **Site-admin > Subscriptions** page. Once a license key has been created for a user, they can sign in to Sourcegraph.com to access it from their user profile.

## How to create a license key for a renewal or upgrade

If an existing company or customer needs a new license key for any reason (e.g., they purchase more seats, they upgrade product tiers, or they simply renew), you can add a new license key to an existing subscription.

Visit the **Site-admin > Subscriptions** page, find the existing subscription, click into it, and follow the steps below (from the "Click **Generate new license manually**" step onwards).

## How to create a license key for a new prospect or new customer

> NOTE: CEs should always consult with Sales before creating license keys for prospects (i.e., companies that have not yet officially become customers).

First, the company's Sourcegraph administrator must create a Sourcegraph.com user account and provide their username. Once that is available,follow the steps below.

- Sign in to Sourcegraph.com and visit the **Site-admin > Subscriptions** page and click **Create product subscription**.
- Find the username and click the **Create product subscription** button.
- Click **Generate new license manually**.
- Add the appropriate tags to the input box (separated by commas, with no spaces). Commonly used tags include:
  - `true-up` to allow the company to go over the user limit on the license.
  - `mau` to indicate that the company is on a monthly usage-based billing model.
  - `trial` to show an indicate in Sourcegraph that the company is on a trial.
  - `enterprise` for Enterprise licenses (formerly Enterprise Full), without batch changes
  - `batch-changes` to add Batch Changes to an Enterprise license
  - `team` for the Team plan
  - `starter` for the Enterprise Starter plan, which functions as Team without user limits (a historical plan—only used for existing customers on this plan, not for new customers or trials)
  - `internal` for licenses used for internal sites (dotcom, k8s, etc.)
  - `dev` for internal developer licenses
  - The company's name (with dashes instead of spaces), to make it easy to search for a given license key in the future.
- Set the licensed number of users (note that if you added the `true-up` tag above, the company will be able to exceed this count, but administrators will see a warning) and the number of days that the license should be valid, and click **Generate license**.
- Finally, click on the **View as user** link, and share the resulting URL with the company.

A typical email to send to a company is:

>Hi,
>I just created a new license key for you that you can find at ___! Just click **Reveal license key**, copy the key, and then save it to your Sourcegraph's site configuration in the `licenseKey` field.

## Future state

Right now, we only use `enterprise`, `team`, and `batch-changes` to indicate plan and features. In the future we will use more granular plans:

  - `plan:team-<version>` to indicate that the company is on team tier, on the given version, e.g. `plan:team-0` (Sales will own knowing the version).
  - `plan:enterprise-<version>` to indicate that the company is on enterprise tier, on the given version, e.g. `plan:enterprise-0` (Sales will own knowing the version).
  - Within the enterprise tier, every feature will need to be included explicitly with a tag, including:
     - `acls`: Whether external code host auth services may be used, such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket Server repository permissions and integration with GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket Server for user authentication.
     - `private-extension-registry`: Whether publishing extensions to this Sourcegraph instance has been purchased. If not, then extensions must be published to Sourcegraph.com. All instances may use extensions published to Sourcegraph.com.
     - `remote-extensions-allow-disallow`: Whether explicitly specify a list of allowed remote extensions and prevent any other remote extensions from being used has been purchased. It does not apply to locally published extensions.
     - `branding`: Whether custom branding of this Sourcegraph instance has been purchased.
     - `batch-changes`: Whether Batch Changes on this Sourcegraph instance has been purchased.
     - `monitoring`: Whether monitoring on this Sourcegraph instance has been purchased.
     - `backup-and-restore`: Whether builtin backup and restore on this Sourcegraph instance has been purchased.
  - For now, if no `plan:*` tag is supplied, the license will be treated as legacy enterprise tier which has unlimited access to all features.

## How to delete a license key

Unfortunately, once a license key is created, it cannot be disabled or deleted.

If the company hasn't yet received or seen the license key, it's easy to hide it. Users can only ever see the latest key associated with their subscription. So just re-follow the steps above (from the "Click **Generate new license key manually**" step onwards) and they will never be able to see the previous key.

However, if a company has already accessed and copied the key, there is nothing we can do to change it. As a result, try to minimize the duration and user count on keys to only that which is actually necessary. As an example, if you want to create an "unlimited" license for a company that has 100 employees, don't create a key that allows 999,999,999 to achieve that. This minimizes any risks of the key becoming exposed. Instead, create one that is close to the actual total, as we can always [create a new, larger key](#how-to-create-a-license-key-for-a-renewal-or-upgrade) for them in the future.
