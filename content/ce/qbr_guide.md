# Creating QBRs for Customers

We often hold QBRs, or Quarterly Business Reviews (sometimes referred to as an Executive Business Review), with our customers which recaps how Sourcegraph has been integrated into and creating value for their organization over the past quarter. These QBRs are typically created and presented by the CE assigned to the account, in conjunction with the account’s AE. They are typically presented in a slide deck format to executive-level leadership, and highlight usage metrics and use cases for their org. Additionally, they are used to gather feedback and comments from leadership regarding Sourcegraph. 

## QBR Content

A typical QBR should consist of the following components. When creating a QBR, it is important to work with the account champion in the weeks leading up to it and ensure that the proposed content is relevant and will resonate with the audience (which should include high-level managers or executives). Note that these can change based on the needs of the customer, but the following is the template we start with:

### Usage Metrics

It’s important to show the user adoption and usage metrics for the customer’s instance over time. This data can be found in [Looker](https://sourcegraph.looker.com/dashboards/94?Unique%20Server%20ID=Uber&Site%20ID=&Salesforce%20Unique%20ID=&filter_config=%7B%22Unique%20Server%20ID%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22%3D%22,%22values%22:%5B%7B%22constant%22:%22Uber%22%7D,%7B%7D%5D,%22id%22:6%7D%5D,%22Site%20ID%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22%3D%22,%22values%22:%5B%7B%22constant%22:%22%22%7D,%7B%7D%5D,%22id%22:7%7D%5D,%22Salesforce%20Unique%20ID%22:%5B%7B%22type%22:%22%3D%22,%22values%22:%5B%7B%22constant%22:%22%22%7D,%7B%7D%5D,%22id%22:8%7D%5D%7D)
and screenshots of the updated DAU, WAU, and MAU dashboards should be taken and included in the QBR. 

### User Surveys/Testimonials

It’s also important to highlight **how** developers and engineers use Sourcegraph and how it provides value to them. We typically send out a survey to the user group 2-3 weeks prior to the QBR in order to get this feedback and include data from the responses as well as individual testimonials in the slide deck. 

An example survey can be found [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-K6LMJQMZ7/). 

### Use Case Highlight

We can also highlight certain product features or use cases that are of interest to the customer, and walk through how they integrate into a user’s workflow and overarching use case, as well as the associated value that it adds. See slide deck below for an example of a Campaigns highlight. 

### Misc

As mentioned earlier, this a general outline and should be customized to the customer’s indivual use cases and needs. If you have any questions about creating or running a QBR, please reach out to the broader CE team - we’re happy to help!
