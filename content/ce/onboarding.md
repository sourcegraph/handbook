# Customer Engineering Onboarding

Welcome to Sourcegraph - we're VERY excited to have you on the Customer Engineering team! This page describes the onboarding philosophy and process for new customer engineers as they onboarding, and outlines expectations and goals of onboarding as well as what success looks like 30 / 60 / 90 days in.


## Company-wide and Customer Engineering-specific Onboarding
Our goal is to have CEs fully ramped by the end of your 4th week. During your first 4 weeks, you will complete a variety of activities intended to both introduce you to the company as a whole, as well as provide you with the knowledge, tools, and support necessary to be a successful CE! 

### Onboarding Tooling
As a company, we use Process.st to guide each individuals' onboarding. Your own custom onboarding plan will be provided to you prior to your first day and will serve as your guide.

### Onboarding Support
Each new CE is paired with two individuals during their onboarding time: an [onboarding buddy](../people-ops/onboarding/buddy-program) and an onboarding mentor. Your onboarding buddy is assigned as part of our company-wide onboarding program. For the CE team, this will be a peer from an adjacent team with whom you'll work closely with. Your onboarding mentor will be someone from the CE team with whom you'll have regular check-ins and will be there to help guide you. Both of these assignments will be indicated in your Process.st checklist.
