# Handbook Home

The Sourcegraph handbook describes how we (Sourcegraph teammates) work. It's publicly visible because we are an [open company](company-info-and-process/about-sourcegraph/index.md#open-company). The table of contents below details what you can find in the handbook.

The handbook is a living document and we expect every teammate to propose improvements, changes, additions, and fixes to keep it continuously up-to-date and accurate. Learn more about the handbook [here](handbook/index.md).
