### View on Customer Support

Customer Support is about tackling immediate problems efficiently and effectively. I want customers to feel good about reaching out for support, knowing that they are helping shape the development of the product they already love.

### Preferred learning style

I prefer to start with high-level concepts using visual models and written language, followed by hands-on experimentation.

### Communication style

I prefer async communication on Slack. I often process my thoughts through writing and revising, so I appreciate the extra time and space async communication provides.

### Collaboration style

Back and forth messaging on Slack is good, but some issues require fully synchronous Zoom calls to communicate.

### Approach to problems

I typically start by drafting a set of hypotheses on what could be broken and test them. Regardless of the initial hypotheses' correctness, they help frame the issue and expose new problems.

### Preferred way to be recognized

A quiet Slack DM is always appreciated.

### What I enjoy at work

I enjoy documenting repeatable solutions to common issues.

### Thoughts on asking for help

I prefer to solve problems independently, but I'm not averse to asking for help once I run out of known resources.

### Preferred time to work

Standard 9-5

### Feelings to receiving messages outside work hours

I'm open to communication outside of work hours, but issues requiring me to have a deployment-capable machine likely need to wait until my next working hours.

### How to show up when I'm feeling off

I process emotions by working on hobbies, so an hour of free time after work on the disc golf course or at my workshop clears up anything I have going on.

### Things that make me anxious

- Lack of immediate direction
- Too much coffee

### Technical areas of knowledge

- Full-Stack Development
- Docker
- AWS

### Technical interests to learn

- Go
- Kubernetes
- Security

### Current personal project

I'm not working on personal projects currently, but I am preparing for future certifications.

### What I fear

My irrational fear is giant squids (no squid should be that big)

### Favorite quote

“Frodo: I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.

Gandalf: So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.”
― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings

### How I eat fries
