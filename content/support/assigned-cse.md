# Assigned Customer Support Engineers

There are certain situations where it just makes sense to assign a Customer Support Engineer to work with a customer (vs handling all issues from the customer round-robin by anyone on the team). For example, we have a couple handfuls of customers we deem strategic in nature. We also have a couple handfuls of pre-sales customers where we know they will benefit from a more high-touch experience.

If you feel a customer should have an assigned CSE, post in #customer-support. The CS leadership team will coordinate with the CE and Sales leadership team to vet the request. In order to provide optimal support for all customers, we can only have ~20 customers (post- and pre- / long-term and temporary) with an assigned CSE.

Customers selected for CSE assignment (whether post-sales strategic customers or pre-sales customers) and the CSEs assigned are listed in [our customer exceptions page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/support/customer-exceptions).

All customers with an assigned CSE (whether internal in nature only or communicated to the customer), benefit from the following:

- CSE is always up to speed when an issue arises, no context building necessary
- CSE maintains emulation of customer’s environment for faster testing (that CE has access to and is accessible by other CSEs on the team if backup is needed)
- CSE attends regular and ad-hoc customer meetings to streamline communication (this should be discussed with CE for pre-sales assignments)
- CSE updates the [technical design documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19qcdFcFpqHNE6OTgO8SwdTF7FfB4AJH6Hlqeywgv6Yc/edit#) when they learn of new information/changes (and informs the CE of the update)
- CSE has a recurring weekly check-in with the CE; some good standing questions:
  - What is going well with the customer?
  - What, if anything, is causing frustration for the customer?
  - What are we currently trying to make happen with this customer (our goals)?
  - What context would be useful to have for anything troubleshooting that may come up?

There are two differences between post-sales strategic customers and pre-sales that allow us to offer this benefit and maintain flexibility where we need it:

1. We do not communicate to pre-sales customers that they have an assigned CSE; this is an internal assignment only. We do communicate to post-sales strategic customers that they have an assigned CSE.
2. Only post-sales strategic customers have an assigned back-up CSE.

A few other details (mostly for CS):

- If anyone is assigned to a customer, they are not expected to work late, outside of their usual working hours, or handle more than the usual workload. If a CSE becomes overloaded or has work that needs to be done outside of their usual hours, they simply need to let the team know via a post in #customer-support-internal so we can figure out how the team can help.
- An assignment is never permanent. A CSE can ask for a transition for a variety of reasons -- including they are stagnating, not being as exposed to different issue types. The best way to ensure an expedite transition is maintaining customer documentation.
- Being assigned doesn’t mean you are expected to know everything. Say you don’t know with confidence, follow-up quickly with confidence, and that will maintain trust with the customer.
- The CS team is welcome to adopt whatever practices we find valuable from being assigned to a wider customer audience. For example, if we see value in solving issues faster because of a certain kind of customer documentation, we can replicate that. Or, if we see value in a customer having an assigned CSE that was not requested by CE or Sales, we can make that happen, too.
