# FY22Q4 OKR Plan

Our objective this quarter is to:

**Make providing an effortless customer experience a habit for each CSE by consistently honoring [our guiding principles](#guiding-principles) and [definitions of success](#we-know-that-we-are-successful-when-we) while maintaining healthy work habits.**

We will measure this via the following key results:

- Anyone on the team will be able to review all open cases and say “yes” we are honoring [our guiding principles](#guiding-principles) and [definitions of success](#we-know-that-we-are-successful-when-we) at least 95% of the time (first test of this will be 2021-12-09 and weekly from there).
- All CSEs will have a sentiment of at least a 2 in at least X% of the technical competency areas outlined in our [technical competency matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1npAo9c_yDGreh1KlUgG0qlG6nTNwW39sl4vTmAvwQu0/edit?usp=sharing).
- All CSEs honor their weekly focus day at least 90% of the time and have taken at least 20-30 days off by the end of the quarter (20 for those who started in June/July; 30 for those who started in February/March).

We will track our progress weekly in [our tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bXOm-oj9VyQwQtIvEfTI3ZRlDV2G5mDCTPBVporbQI8/edit?usp=sharing).
