# Support Team Schedule

Being an [all-remote](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/remote) company means that we can choose to work when we want. This is absolutely true for CSEs and it is also a little more complicated for us. We have to coordinate a little more so we can honor our [service level agreements (SLAs)](../support/index.md#our-service-level-agreements-slas).

This starts by everyone on the team identifying their ideal working hours. If we have good coverage, we are set! If we have gaps, we work together to figure out a solution.

Our schedule also makes it clear when folks on the team have dedicated heads-down focus time.

## Schedule
Our schedule is reflected in the working hours set in our calendars and blocks held on our calendar for our focus blocks.

|Team member|Local hours|Pacific hours|Focus block|Focus block
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Adeola|10am - 6pm|7am - 3pm|Wednesday PM|Thursday AM|
|Beatrix|7am - 3pm|7am - 3pm|Wednesday AM|Thursday AM|
|Carl|6am - 2pm|3am - 11am|TBD|TBD|
|Giselle|8am - 4pm|8am - 4pm|Monday PM|Friday AM|
|Stompy|1pm - 9pm|3am - 11am|Monday AM|Wednesday AM|
|Warren|9am - 5pm|9am - 5pm|Monday PM|Thursday PM|
|Virginia|8am - 5pm|8am - 5pm|n/a|n/a|

Focus blocks are listed simply as which 1/2 of which day

## Adjusting the schedule
* **Ad-hoc adjustments** can be shared in the team Slack channel (#customer-support-internal).
* **Lasting adjustments** can be discussed in our weekly 1:1s.

If an adjustment creates a gap in covering our SLAs, we will figure it out!
