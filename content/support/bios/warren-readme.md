### My view on customer support

If a customer reaches out for help, they should feel like they are rewarded for that effort. Making folks feel comfortable asking questions is almost as important to me as having answers to questions. Having clear answers to questions of how is crucial, but its nice if on occasion to slip in a bit of why as well. Ideally I would hope that after a customer support issue is a resolved customers feel that they got to partake in a community developing a product they appreciate, and that by asking for support they contributed to improving Sourcegraph.

### Preferred learning styles

I really like to learn verbally. I tend to process and absorb information most deeply through dialogues. Sometimes lively discourse (arguments) if the feeling is right. Theres also no substitute for a good solo studying flowstate though. Finally who could forget learning by teaching.

### Communication style

I try to be transparent, usually I'm processing while I'm talking. When I'm writing I'm a lot more likely to be thoughtful, but, I also think I'm clearer and more fun when I'm speaking. Generally Zoom > Slack for me.

### Preferred way to collaborate

Love to mob code and talk through things in flight. I often need time to chew on things and process. I am usually pretty open to trying things a different way, and can change approach fairly readily. Do not like being rushed. Theres a lot to be said for getting out a good MVP, but fast is not always fast imo.

### How I approach problems

I like to spend some time up front really grokking a subject before I move into any sort of solution planning. I'll often consult peers early to get feedback and perspective from my network. Then after some time I like to develop some systemic understnading of a problem or types of problems. No rigid systems though.

### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

If everyone could just be hushed in awe by my presence, and like, lay laurel wreathes around me that would be great, but also don't expect me to appreciate it.

### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

When asking me for help I don't mind open ended questions, and if I can help I generally love to. When I ask for help I try to do so early and often, that said, I usually ask for help about things when I know a little already and I'm looking for opinions. I find it a lot more challenging to ask for help when it comes to fundemenatals and I really struggle with getting help when it comes to "basics", this is something that maybe has served me at times, but also I should try to be conscience of.

### What I find enjoyable at work

People 100%, I really value working with people I respect on things I care about.

### What kind of work do I find easiest to do when

I find it easiest to work at night. I'm really just not a morning person. That said I can do meetings in the morning pretty well. I find it pretty challenging to get any sort of flow state in the morning though. I think distractions are a real challenge for me, and as such I actually really relish weekend because there are usually fewer distractions. If I could convince folks to work with me after working hours on projects and coding I most certainly would.

### How do I feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for me to see and respond to during active hours

I don't mind, but I can't garuntee I'll respond, it really depends on how the issue is related to work. Sometimes I might not even have the bandwidth to figure out what the issue is until I'm back on working hours. Other times I'm like yeah, lets just do a zoom meeting real quick.

### How folks can best show up for me when I seem off

Run for the hills... jk. I'm usually pretty aware of where I'm at and transparent, but, if I'm negatively effecting you due to a mood and don't seem to realise it, please let me know. Its never really my intention to hurt peoples feelings, but everyone slips up sometimes. I like to think you won't really know if I'm upset and concealing it, and if thats what I'm doing then I probably don't want to talk about things.

### Things I am aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

I think just the usual stuff, sometimes expectations that I know stuff I dont know. Passive aggressive behavior from peers.

### Technical areas of knowledge

I know a little bit about a number of technical things. At this point I feel pretty comfortable with fullstack development, AWS, Docker, and a number of other things. I'm really a generalist and still learning a lot.

### Technical areas of interest to learn

Kubernetes, Go, C, networking, security, more about unix-like environments and bash scripting

### Current personal project

I need to get one of those thats not work related.

### Something I fear

Oh man its got to be that creeping nihilism

### A quote I like

“I am his highness’s dog at Kew; / Pray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?” -Alexander Pope

### How I eat fries

greek fries, tzatziki, or other fries with spicy ketchup or ranch

### My sun, moon, and rising signs

Aries Sun, Leo Moon, Virgo Rising. Thats a whole lot of fire sign capped off with an earth sign, so, I like to think of this as a volcano.
