## Carl Hicks

[Bio on team page](../../company/team/index.md#carl-hicks)

### View on Customer Support

I generally always assume good intent and approach problems with empathy. Our customers have a job they are trying to get done; how do we remove the immediate barrier to allow them to do that. (Bonus points if you can teach them how to unblock themselves in the future.)

### Preferred learning style

My default learning style is hands-on (physical). If I can take it apart (dig in the code), I can generally start to grok the fundamental concepts.

### Communication style

I generally prefer asynchronous communication. An email (Slack message) is excellent because I feel some things need thought, and I will be the first to admit I don't know all the answers.
(Unpopular opinion Slack might not be as async as advertised ... we only tend to stroll back so far. We do transfer most important things to the Handbook through 😉)

### Collaboration style

Pretty open in this area ... pairing/zoom/group chat/google doc (Just want to get the ideas out)

### Approach to problems

**K.I.S.S**
(**K**eep **I**t **S**uper **S**imple)  
I generally like to step back, level set, to make sure I completely understand the problem. Which helps me properly parse through false flags and ask the right questions to find the root cause.

### Preferred way to be recognized

I prefer to fly under the radar. I have never been good at taking praise.

### What I enjoy at work

The feeling of moving the mission forward.

### Thoughts on asking for help

I do not have an issue asking for help but tend to try to go at it alone until I exhaust all my known resources.

### Preferred time to work

My default mode is nocturnal; however, I'm pretty flexible.
(Since having little humans, I tend to sleep in smaller blocks and am seemingly always up.)

### Feelings to receiving messages outside work hours

Growing up in ops, being tethered to a pager/communication tool is something I'm generally used to. As a general rule, I do not enable notification except for rare occasions, so the response may be slow.
(I tend to use the Pomodoro method when working, so I use breaks to check social/chat. When not working ... I will respond once I have a free moment but can't promise when that will be)

### How to show up when I'm feeling off

I will get through it ... just leave me be.

### Things that make me anxious

- Disorganization
- Visible battery indicators (turn them off is liberating)

### Technical areas of knowledge

- Bash
- Containers
- Kubernetes
- Linux
- cloud platforms (AWS/Azure)

### Technical interests to learn

- Go
- C
- Linux Kernel development

### Current personal project

Not really working on a project but working toward [CKA](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/)

### What I fear

While extremely irrational, getting a paper cut on my eye is something I worry about a little more than one should.

### Favorite quote

> Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. - Mike Tyson

### How I eat fries

I now use an air fryer for everything (no longer cook with oil). I will generally eat them with out anything on them or with hot sauce.

### Sun, moon and rising signs

Up until just a few mins ago, I had zero clues as to what any of this meant:  
I'm a Gemini Ascendant, Virgo with a Taurus moon  
(Someone will have to explain this too me but that is what the internet says ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )
