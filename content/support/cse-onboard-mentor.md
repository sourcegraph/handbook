# CSE Onboarding Mentor

As an onboarding mentor, your goal is to be the onboarding mentor you would love to have when starting a new role.
Be as patient, as detailed, and as relevant as you would want someone to be with you when joining a company and learning about your day-to-day.

During the duration of your time as a mentor, you are able to pull back some availability for taking new tickets, unless you feel that a ticket that comes in may be a good learning example for yourself and your mentee to talk through.

Don't ever feel pressured to know everything when you're a mentor. If you are asked a question by your mentee that you are unsure of, be sure to be honest about your uncertainty and tell him or her that you will reach out to places where you can find the right answer.

Remember, being an oboarding mentee is not a chore or something that is “taking up your time”. This is something we all need to do to support each other. The more you can be there for your mentee, the stronger the CSE team will continue to be. If you feel you cannot be an effective mentee for whatever reason, let management know ahead of time.

# Meeting cadence and guidelines:

## Week 4

- Assist them with their first few tickets. Make it clear that you aren’t to solve their tickets but to show them how to find information they need, suggest theories, how to ask for information, troubleshooting tips, communicate with customers, SLA, talk about engaging engineering and our metrics briefly, remind them where we go to learn how to interact with teams if needed, github issue creation.. Etc.

I would suggest doing these first meetings over video chat to get to know our teammate better. Following these meetings, once a new teammate has begun to assist our customers, continue to be there for your async as much as you can.
