# Contract review and signature authority policy

Effective and last modified June 21, 2021

The purpose of this policy is to help you direct your contracts to the right team or teammate to review, approve, and sign. 

This policy covers the following types of contracts:

1. NDAs
1. Customer contracts
1. Vendor contracts
1. Partner contracts

If you are not sure where to direct a contract for review, approval, or signature, you can reach out to the legal team.

## How to submit requests for review

Legal:

* [legal@sourcegraph.com](mailto:legal@sourcegraph.com) or
* #legal slack channel

Give us about 1 business day to acknowledge receipt and give you an estimated turnaround time. If you don’t hear back from us in about 1 business day, follow up to make sure we saw your request. If your request is time-sensitive, let us know the ideal turnaround time.

Finance:

* [finance@sourcegraph.com](mailto:finance@sourcegraph.com) or
* #finance slack channel

If you submit a request via #legal or #finance slack channels, no need to duplicate your request in each channel. You can just post your request in one channel and tag the other team.

* [Customer contracts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ePvVWcZYdd1_3ZlCP5A0lvMbBhBCVfSm) as Year-Month-Date-Customer-Contract Name
