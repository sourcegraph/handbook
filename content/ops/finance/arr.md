c.      Contract execution
 
a.      Evaluation stage
Best practice procurement processes should commence with the following steps:
- defining the requirement (e.g. quantity, quality, delivery, timing)
- assessing other strategies such as utilizing existing period contract arrangements
- obtaining financial & Legal approval

Approval Levels
The table below presents the approval levels required for expenditure, based on $ amounts. Amounts below are in US dollars, inclusive of all taxes and charges.  For procurement that exceeds an annual equivalent of $10,000, the Finance team will complete a PO.

|Amount (Annual Equivalent)|Approval Required|Recommend Method of Payment|
|---|---|---|
|$0 - $1,000|Does not require specific approval|Expensify / Remote.com / Brex / Bill.com|
|$1,000 to $10,000|Needs to be approved by a director or above of your department|Brex / Bill.com via Sourcegraph AP team|

|$50,000 or greater|Needs to be approved by a director or above of your department, Finance, and the VP of Operations|Bill.com via Sourcegraph AP Team|

b.     Go-to-market Stage
 
Best practice guidelines relating to the go-to-market stage of procurement includes:
 
- identifying how to approach the market and engage in negotiations
- determining the number of quotes to obtain
- determining the selection/evaluation process
- engaging in commercial negotiations with chosen supplier

Request for Quotes Process
Sourcegraph employees must request competitive quotes, in writing, as far as practicable, as presented in table 2 below.
|Spend (Annual Equivalent)|Quotes|
|---|---|
|$0 - $10,000|1|
|$10,000 - $50,000|2|
|$50,000 or greater|3|

The number of quotes sought can be restricted to less than the required number if there are legitimate reasons for limiting the number of suppliers. Such reasons might include:

- only a limited number of suppliers with the capability, experience and suitability to meet the procurement requirement
- the need for compatibility with existing equipment or services
- absence of competition due to technical reasons (e.g. exclusivity, proprietary information)
- the cost of changeover is prohibitive
- an unsolicited proposal with very advantageous conditions and appropriate approval
- time sensitive
 
The justification for limiting the number of suppliers must be communicated via email to ap@sourcegraph.com.
 
Sourcegraph employees should also inquire as to whether customer references / testimonials are available for items of expenditure greater than $10,000. 

Commercial Negotiations

The table below highlights different commercial terms of a procurement negotiation, in order of importance to Sourcegraph. Buyers are encouraged to consult with the Finance team if they require support during commercial negotiations with suppliers.

c.      Contractual Documents
 
Contract Management

Supplier contracts must be reviewed and approved by Sourcegraph Legal team prior to signing in accordance with (insert link to legal page). Designated buyers should submit a brief summary of key commercial terms (term, price, auto renewal, etc.) to legal along with the contract for signing.
 
Contract management should include:

- Ensuring contracts are reviewed by appropriate personnel to assess legal and commercial impact.
- Ensuring roles and responsibilities for managing the contract have been identified and understood by the relevant parties
- Ensuring the contract is effectively implemented and that the supplier delivers the requirements of the contract
- Addressing any issues that arise during the contract term
- Ensuring the key terms (price, term, owner) are stored in the contract register (discussed below)
- Processing invoices for payment on a timely basis in line with agreed provisions in the contract

Contract Register

The Sourcegraph Finance department will maintain a contract register to record expenditure valued at greater than $10,000 (annualized amount). 
 
Contract Renewals

Designated buyers (employees who are responsible for the spend) should monitor contract end dates or renewal dates to ensure that:
- Renegotiations can commence in a timely manner, in advance of cessation or renewal
- Sourcegraph employees can go to market to request additional quotes from alternative suppliers (if required)
- If desired, that a vendor / contractor can be terminated by Sourcegraph allowing for any required notice period

New Supplier Form

Once the contract is agreed, if this is the first time Sourcegraph has used this supplier, the designated buyer should request the supplier to complete a new supplier form if required. Refer to “Sourcegraph New Supplier form 

Confidential Information

All information received from suppliers is to be treated as confidential. Further, if the vendor has any access to information which Sourcegraph considers confidential, the Sourcegraph employee should consult with the legal team and consider if a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is required.
 
 
5.      Other Considerations
 
Managing Conflicts of Interest
Any actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest that has the potential to unfairly affect or influence the proper outcome of the procurement process, must be identified and documented in the purchase order requisition.
