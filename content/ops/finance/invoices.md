# Submitting an invoice (teammates based outside of US)

## Monthly invoices

Any teammates based outside of the US are on a contracting structure and will need to submit an invoice once a month for payment.

### Please follow the process below for submitting monthly invoices:

- All invoices should be sent via email to our accounting team, sourcegraph@officengine.com, with finance@sourcegraph.com copied on all emails. All invoices will be paid through [Veem](https://www.veem.com/).You should have received an invite to your personal email for a Veem account as part of onboarding.
- Please note: You do not need to submit an invoice via Veem.
- Invoices should be submitted in the currency used in your contract (and USD by default), if expenses were purchased in a different currency, please use this currency converter: https://www1.oanda.com/currency/converter/ and use the date of transaction. (Do not use the Veem currency converter.)
- Include any fringe benefits on your invoice as individual line items as well (cell phone, internet, wellness benefits, etc.).
- If additional expenses are incurred that month (i.e. home desk setup), please provide a separate invoice and attach all expense receipts to the same email.
- Submit monthly invoices by the 2nd of the month so that payments can be issued by the 5th.
- Your monthly invoice amount depends on whether you work a full month or a partial month.
  - **Full month**: to find your monthly invoice amount, refer to your contract, which should state the monthly rate (or take your annual pay and divide it by 12 to arrive at the monthly amount). Most months are full months, including when you take PTO or when there are holidays.
  - **Partial month**: use the formula below to prorate partial months. Partial months happen, for example, if your contract starts in the middle of a month.
    - Divide your full month invoice amount by 173.33 hours (average hours worked per month based on 40 hour weeks for 52 weeks, according to IRS).
    - Multiply by the number of hours you worked in the pay period.
    - Example: If you get paid $6000 per month and worked 5 days (40 hours): 6000 / 173.33 = 34.62 x 40 = $1384.8
