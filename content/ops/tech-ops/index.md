# Tech Operations (formerly known as Internal Tools)

**The tech operations team does not yet exist.** It is a team we want to create and grow. The Tech Ops team will help build, integrate, improve, and maintain our internal tools and applications.

## Team

We are hiring for the Tech Ops team! See all [open positions](../roles/index.md).

## Vision

As we scale our team and our customer list, we need help building, integrating, improving, and maintaining all of the applications and internal tools that are straining to keep up. From making it easier to onboard new teammates with single sign-on software, to developing custom GitHub and Slack bots, to configuring and maintaining Salesforce, to identifying gaps in our internal processes and recommending system improvements, the Tech Ops team is an essential part of keeping Sourcegraph running smoothly.
