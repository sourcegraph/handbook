# Operations requests for comment (OpsRFCs)

>Note: See our [engineering RFC documentation](../communication/rfcs/index.md) for more context on why and how we use requests for comment internally.

Ops RFCs help the operations team asynchronously provide context on a problem, create a project plan to address that problem, and solicit feedback from other members of our team.

Ops RFCs are designed to be lightweight so that they can be used for many purposes, and it is optimized for facilitating collaboration and feedback. In contrast, project execution tracking systems (such as GitHub project boards, Google Tables, Asana, and similar) are best for tracking progress against plans.

_All Ops RFCs are in a [public Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BFW91sECBDIyrq2XLm5zEgJjfadpDpaR)._

## Ops RFCs are RFCs

Ops RFCs are [RFCs](../communication/rfcs/index.md). While Ops RFCs live in a different folder and have a slightly different template, the underlying principles are the same, and Ops RFCs may be referred to simply as RFCs (though on this page, they are referred to as "Ops RFCs" specifically to draw a distinction).

They:

- [Have statuses](../communication/rfcs.md#status)
- [Are sequentially numbered](../communication/rfcs.md#rfcs-are-sequentially-numbered)
- [Are Google Docs](../communication/rfcs.md#rfcs-are-google-docs)
- [Have a defined structure](../communication/rfcs.md#rfc-structure)
- [Are public](../communication/rfcs.md#rfcs-are-public)

### Why are Ops RFCs separated from RFCs?

Ops RFCs have been separated from RFCs for a few reasons:

- They live in a different folder, to keep relevant documents organized together. This helps team members save time scrolling through hundreds of irrelevant RFCs before finding the one they need.
- They have slightly different structures and prompts to make them as relevant as possible to operations team workflows (e.g., operations team members may not use GitHub issues, so references to them are removed).
