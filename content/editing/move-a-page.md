# Moving a Page

### GitHub Web Interface

All of the following needs to occur within one pull request. See [this page](multiple-changes-single-pr.md) for help on making multiple edits at once.

1. Rename the file to indicate its new location as described in [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location)
1. Address any broken link errors in the [Handbook Checks](handbook-check-failures.md#broken-link). Since you are changing the location of a file, any existing links to that file will break. You may see errors like this:
