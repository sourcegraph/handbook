# Add Yourself to the Team Page

### Steps:

1. Accept GitHub's email invite to the Sourcegraph org (you should be a member of [the `Everyone` group](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/everyone) in Sourcegraph's GitHub organization).
1. Add yourself to the [team.yml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/blob/main/data/team.yml") by modifying the example below
1. In the edit view, copy the example, paste it at the end of the edit view, and make it about yourself! Look at others' bios for more examples.
1. Under "Commit changes" at the bottom of the page, replace the "Update team.yml" text with a summary of your change, e.g., Add Alex to team page.
1. Click the green "Commit changes" button. If you do not see the green "Commit Changes" button, refer to step 1. Successful changes will become visible shortly (but not immediately).

  description: "Chris started his career making games, working on Civilization III and Alpha Centauri. Chris also spent several years working at Opera Software in Norway, mainly on Opera's Ecmascript engine. Somewhere in there, Chris accidentally wrote a book, [Learn to Program](https://pragprog.com/titles/ltp3/learn-to-program-third-edition/). At New Relic, Chris moved into management, and (much to his surprise) loved it! Chris lives with his spouse (Katy), their three kids (C, Ruby, and Apl), three rats, a little dog, and an ancient grey cat. Hobbies include the boardgame Go, failing to play the guitar, and spiritual inquiry (mostly Tao, Zen, and Alan Watts). Chris really (like really) loves parentheses."
