# Editing the handbook

Every Sourcegraph teammate will be editing the Sourcegraph handbook frequently to keep information up-to-date and participate in important changes in the company. This guide helps everyone learn how to edit the handbook.

The handbook consists of Markdown files in the Git repository at [github.com/sourcegraph/handbook](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/tree/main/content). ([Why not a wiki or Google Docs?](usage.md#wiki-and-google-docs-handbooks-become-stale))

## How to get help

We don't expect everyone on the team to figure this out on their own. Other teammates are happy to help!

- Any engineer at Sourcegraph can help. (The _code_ that engineers write at Sourcegraph also consists of files in a Git repository, so engineers are very familiar with making these kinds of edits.)
- [Teammates who have already made a handbook change](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/about/-/stats/contributors?path=handbook%2F) can help.
- **Handbook support**: Ask the @handbook-support group in Slack (formerly called "handbook heroes"), including @aharvey, @virginia, @ines, @jyavorska, @marybelzer, and @jean, for handbook help (via DM, #handbook, or #any-question). They volunteered to help anyone with anything handbook-related! _If you too want to be part of handbook support, simply edit this page, add your name to the list and ping @handbook-support in the #handbook channel to inform them_
- Ask in #handbook: "Who can screen-share with me to help me make an edit to the handbook?"
- Don't be afraid of breaking anything! It is very easy for any engineer on the team to roll back to the previous version of the handbook if you make a mistake.
