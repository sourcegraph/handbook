# Editing the Handbook FAQs

Before asking the #handbook channel for help, see if your question can be answered below. If you see a question being commonly asked in the #handbook channel, feel free to add it and the answer to this page.

## When will I see my changes live in the Handbook?

**TL;DR,** your changes will be live and viewable anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours after merging.

The Handbook deployment process runs fairly quickly, and your changes are deployed within a few minutes after your merge. However, browser caching may prevent you from seeing your changes for a while. Closing the tab with your recently updated Handbook page and revisiting later is the simplest way to check on your Handbook changes.

You can [clear your cache](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop), try viewing your page in an [incognito window](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop), or ask a teammate if they can see your changes if you’re still not seeing them after a few hours.

## Why do I need to keep updating my branch?

You may see the following message:

- Your branch is out-of-date with the base branch.

![Branch is Out of Date](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/branch-out-of-date.png)

This means someone else has made changes on the main branch that you need to pull into your branch to move forward. If you were to merge your branch as is, your changes could conflict with the changes made by another teammate. Clicking “Update branch” will trigger Handbook Checks to run again, and you can then merge your changes.

The best way to avoid this is to merge your changes often. Sometimes on commonly edited pages (like the [Team page}(RELATIVE PATH)), this is hard to avoid.
