# Deleting a Page

### GitHub Web Interface

See [this Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/deleting-files-in-a-repository#deleting-a-file) for deleting a file or directory through the web interface. You may encounter Handbook checks errors. Since you are changing the location of a file, any existing links to that file will break. You may see errors like this, which are explained in the [Handbook Checks](#handbook-checks) section of this page:
