# Markdown Tips & Resources

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a text markup language to allow plain text to convert to styled text using common conventions, such as _italics_ or ~~strikethrough~~. Itâ€™s just a shortcut to edit text (bolding, italicizing, underlining, etc.) without having to click the buttons on a toolbar. We use Markdown to [edit the Sourcegraph Handbook](editing.md).
