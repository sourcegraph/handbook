# Extending an Offer

Once we identify a finalist candidate, please follow the below steps to formally extend an offer.

## Offer stage

- Step 1: once finalist is identified, Recruiter completes references if necessary.
  - COMING SOON: reference check philosophy
- Step 2: the **Recruiter** confirms level and compensation.
  - [Compensation philosophy](../people-ops/compensation/index.md#components-of-compensation)
- Step 3: the Recruiter has a pre-closing conversation with the candidate to confirm mutual-interest. It is very important that the Recruiter makes no offer promises or commitments to the candidate until the offer has been formally approved in Greenhouse.
  - COMING SOON: closing best practices & counter offer conversation best practices
- Step 4: the **Recruiter** submits offer for approval in Greenhouse.
  - Approval chain: VP Talent > Hiring Manager > Department Head > VP Operations.
  - If the candidate did not recieve all "Yes" or "Strong Yes" in feedback, the Hiring Manager or Recruiter needs to submit written justification for moving forward with offer in the offer approval section.
- Step 5: once the offer is **fully approved** in Greenhouse, Recruiter schedules an offer summary call. The purpose of the offer summary call is to review our offer with the candidate and answer any questions they may have.
  - Attendees: Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate.
  - To generate the offer summary, click "generate" in the Offer Details section of the candidate's Greenhouse profile.
  - Offer Summary call agenda: 1. the Hiring Manager kicks off the call to give the candidate feedback and tell why we’re excited about them 2. the Recruiter then shares their screen to display the offer summary document. The Recruiter then covers our compensation philosophy, the compensation specifics, perks, travel (and benefits, if applicable), and equity 3. the Hiring Manager and Recruiter answer any questions and ask how the candidate is feeling about the opportunity. Before ending the call, be sure to 1) determine a potential start date (all start dates should fall on a cohort Monday and any exceptions to that rule require approval from VP of Talent, Noemi, and Inés) and 2) schedule a follow-up call to answer any questions.
  - COMING SOON: offer summary call script
- Step 6: following the offer call, the Recruiter sends the offer summary to the candidate in an email, and Cc's the Hiring Manager and VP Talent.
- Step 7: once the candidate verbally accepts the offer, the Recruiter makes a formal request in the Slack channel: talent-scheduling-and-offers for an offer letter to be sent
- Step 8: the Recruiting Coordinator sends the official offer letter via DocuSign.
  - For US offers, use the US-offer template
  - For non-US, confirm the correct template before sending
  - All offers should be routed for signing to VP Talent > Candidate and Cc Recruiting@sourcegraph.com, Onboarding@sourcegraph.com and the Hiring Manager
