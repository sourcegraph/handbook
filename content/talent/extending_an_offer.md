## Offer stage

Step 1: once finalist is identified, Recruiter completes references if necessary.

Step 2: the **Recruiter** confirms level and compensation.
- [Compensation philosophy](../people-ops/compensation/index.md#components-of-compensation)

Step 3: the Recruiter has a pre-closing conversation with the candidate to confirm mutual-interest. It is very important that the Recruiter makes no offer promises or commitments to the candidate until the offer has been formally approved in Greenhouse.

Step 4: the **Recruiter** submits the offer for approval in Greenhouse.
- Approval chain: VP Talent > Hiring Manager > Department Head > VP Operations.
- We want to hire people who overwhelmingly get `Yes` and `Strong Yes` feedback.  If the candidate did not recieve all `"Yes"` or `"Strong Yes"` in feedback, the Hiring Manager or Recruiter needs to submit written justification for moving forward with offer in the offer approval section.

Step 5: once the offer is **fully approved** in Greenhouse, Recruiter schedules an offer summary call. The purpose of the offer summary call is to review our offer with the candidate and answer any questions they may have.
- Attendees: Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate.
- To generate the offer summary, click "generate" in the Offer Details section of the candidate's Greenhouse profile.
- Offer Summary call agenda: 
  - Tthe Hiring Manager kicks off the call to give the candidate feedback and tell why weâ€™re excited about them. 
  - The Recruiter then shares their screen to display the offer summary document. 
  - The Recruiter then covers our compensation philosophy, the compensation specifics, perks, travel (and benefits, if applicable), and equity.
  - The Hiring Manager and Recruiter answer any questions and ask how the candidate is feeling about the opportunity. 
  - Before ending the call, be sure to 1) determine a potential start date (all start dates should fall on a cohort Monday and any exceptions to that rule require approval from VP of Talent and People Ops) and 2) schedule a follow-up call to answer any questions.

Step 6: following the offer call, the Recruiter sends the offer summary to the candidate in an email, and Cc's the Hiring Manager and VP Talent.

Step 7: once the candidate verbally accepts the offer, the Recruiter follows the below steps:
- If US-based candidate: make a formal request in the Slack channel `talent-scheduling-and-offers` for an offer letter to be sent via DocuSign.
- If a Contractor candidate: make a formal request in the Slack channel `talent-scheduling-and-offers` for an offer letter to be sent via DocuSign.
- If onboarding via a PEO, make a formal request in the Slack channel 'peo-visa-hiring` to beging the PEO onboarding process
  - COMING SOON: learn more about hiring via PEOs here

Step 8: the candidate recieves the offer.
- For US-based offers, the Recruiting Operations Specialist will send the `US-offer template` via DocuSign.
- For non-US based offers (Contractors), the Recruiting Operations Specialist will confirm the correct template and will send via DocuSign.
  - All DocuSigns should be routed for signing to VP Talent > Candidate and Cc Recruiting@sourcegraph.com, Onboarding@sourcegraph.com and the Hiring Manager
- For PEO candidates, the candidate will recieve all offer documentation via the PEO.
