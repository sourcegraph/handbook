# Types of interviews 

The below information is intended to help our candidates prepare for each step of the interview. Please note that the example questions are **examples only** and may not be the exact questions asked in the actual interview process. 

## The interview process 

Our hiring managers work with their [assigned recruiter](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent#talent-team-members) to create an optimal interview plan for their role. Below is an example. All steps in bold are strongly encouraged.
 
All role-specific interview processes are documented at the end of each [job description](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91). 
We strive for consistency across all interviews.

## Structured interview questions
We ask structured questions for all interviews, meaning that all candidates are asked the same questions in an effort to reduce bias and to even the playing-field. The interview [may be recorded](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire) so that we can focus on the candidate, not taking notes, and ensure that we're delivering a great interview experience. If a candidate prefers not to be recorded during the interview, they can let us know - the structure of the interview and decision-making process will remain the same and the decision not to be recorded will have no weight on their candidacy.

# Universal interviews 

All departments are likely to have some or all of the below universal interview stages:

## Recruiter screen

  -  Tell me about your work experience, past to present.
