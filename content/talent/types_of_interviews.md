# Types of interviews 

The below information is intended to help our candidates prepare for each step of the interview. Please note that the example questions are **examples only** and may not be the exact questions asked in the actual interview process. 

## The interview process 

Our hiring managers work with their [assigned recruiter](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent#talent-team-members) to create an optimal interview plan for their role. Below is an example. All steps in bold are strongly encouraged.
 
All role-specific interview processes are documented at the end of each [job description](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91). 
We strive for consistency across all interviews. 
 
- **Recruiter screen**
- **Hiring manager screen**
- Assignment, if applicable
- In-depth Interview stage:
  -  Resume deep dive
  -  Assignment review/working session, if applicable
  -  Technical interview, if applicable
  -  **Cross-team collaboration interview**
  -  **Peer interview**
  -  **Values interview**
  -  Leadership interview
- Reference checks / offer

## Structured interview questions
We ask structured questions for all interviews, meaning that all candidates are asked the same questions in an effort to reduce bias and to even the playing-field. The interview [may be recorded](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire) so that we can focus on the candidate, not taking notes, and ensure that we're delivering a great interview experience. If a candidate prefers not to be recorded during the interview, they can let us know - the structure of the interview and decision-making process will remain the same and the decision not to be recorded will have no weight on their candidacy.

# Universal interviews 

All departments are likely to have some or all of the below universal interview stages:

## Recruiter screen 
- Interviewer: the assigned recruiter for the role.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Details: the goal of the recruiter screen is to learn more about your background and interest in Sourcegraph. In addition to learning about you, the Recruiter will also tell you about Sourcegraph, the role, compensation/benefits, the interview process, and answer any questions you have.  
- Example questions: 
  -  Tell me about your work experience, past to present.
  -  Why are you looking for something new?
  -  Why are you interested in Sourcegraph and our open position?
  -  What are you looking for in your next role, and what are you career goals?
  -  Do you have overlap with a specific timezone? (only applicable for roles that have time zone requirements)
  -  Tell us how much exposure, if any, you have had working with teammates across time zones. How did you stay connected and up-to-date with your team?
  -  What is your ideal start date?
  -  Are your compensation expectations in line with our compensation range, which is XYZ?  
  -  What questions do you have for us?

## Hiring Manager screen

## Resume deep dive 
- Interviewer(s): the hiring manager or a peer leads the Resume deep dive, and sometimes there is another teammate who shadows the interview.
- Duration: 60-minutes.
- Details: a resume deep dive (often referred to as a "Topgrade Interview") is an interview style where we take a deep dive into a candidate's background, past to present.  The goal of a resume deep dive is to uncover the motivation behind a candidate's decision making, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments in past roles. [Here](https://www.lever.co/blog/topgrading-interview-guide/) is a document to help guide expectations on this stage in the interview process. This is simply an example of what to expect, and does not represent the questions we will be asking.
- Example questions: 
  -  How did you find your job?  Why did you choose to accept it?
  -  Who hired you? What was their name? What did they hire you to do?
  -  Why would your former boss say were your strengths and opportunities for growth?
  -  What did you like most and least about your job?
  -  What would your peers say about you?
  -  What are you most proud of accomplishing while in your job?
  -  Why did you leave?

## Peer interview 
- Interviewer(s): the other members of the team for which you're interviewing.
- Duration: 30-45 minutes.
- Details: during the peer interview, your potential future colleagues will assess if you will be a value-add to the team, take and give constructive criticism, and be an overall supportive team member. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions directed to your potential future peers.
- Example questions: 
  -  Tell us about the best team you've ever been a part of.
  -  Tell us about a time when you had to put your team's interests above your own. 

## Cross-team collaboration interview 
- Interviewer(s): people outside of your respective department who you would cross-collaborate with regularly.  
- Duration: 30-45 minutes.
- Details: during this stage of the interview process, you will meet with members of another team with whom you would partner regularly.  The goal of this interview is to understand how you communicate and collaborate with cross-functional partners within Sourcegraph. 
- Example questions: 
  -  Tell us about a recent project you worked on where you collaborate with people outside of your department
  -  Tell me about a project where you or your team had a disagreement with someone in another function

## Administrative 
- Executive Business Partner working session scenario
  - Interviewer(s): Kacie Jenkins, Katerina Nikolova, Gregg Stone, and Kelsey Nagel 
  - Duration: 60-minutes.
  - Details: The goal of this working session is to give us all a sense of what it would be like to work together. Below is a hypothetical situation that we would like to play out during this 60-minute session.

    You are new to the role (30 days) when Kacie and Gregg ask you to meet and discuss organizing an in-person event for       the sales/marketing teams. The idea behind this event is to build strong relationships among team members and align on     goals. 

    Your objective in this meeting is to: 

   1. Gather all the information that you need in order to be successful at planning and executing this event.
   2. Provide recommendations, share potential ideas, and discuss solutions with Kacie and Gregg.

    -  1.Create an account if you don’t already have one
    -  2.Click the green+in the top right (‘Create report’)to access the workspace
    -  3.We’ll be using the following Mode Public Warehousetables to complete the exercise:tutorials.playbook_users,tutorials.playbook_events,tutorials.playbook_experiments,tutorials.playbook_emails
    
 - Prompt: For each of the following questions please create charts and/or tables (within Mode orby exporting to a spreadsheet tool if that’s easier)to show your findings. We’re not expecting a slide deck or document to explain your findings, but quick summaries of charts, if needed, are just fine. Keep in mind that in most cases there are no “right” or “wrong” answers; we’re more interested in your approach and thought processes.
    - 1.What company is most engaged with the product?
    - 2.We ran an A/B test (experiment) to increase ‘like_message’actions users are taking. Which variant would you recommend going forward with, if any?
 - When you’ve completed the project, share your results via static run links along with some availability you have over the next week to review the project with  a BizOps team members. When reviewing, you can expect questions about your approach in getting to know the data, the process you took to findthe results, results themselves, and how you decidedto communicate your findings.

## Customer Support
- Customer Support Manager
  -  Direct Report Interview
    -  During this stage of the interview process, we will get an understanding of your leadership capabilities
    -  Example questions:
      -  Tell us about how you created trust with your last team
      -  Tell us what you do when someone makes a mistake
  -  Technical Savvy Interview
   - During this stage of the interview process, we will discuss our product, customers, and technology and determine if you will be effective in a technology leadership role.

## Customer Engineering
- Customer Engineer Take Home & Live Project Interview
  -  For this interview we want to give you an opportunity to learn about our product! Sourcegraph has a public version of our product available here to let users get a sense of product capabilities - it’s connected to public Github repositories. We’ll use this instance to guide the project portion of the interview which will be conducted live, via Zoom, with a customer engineer on the team.
  -  There are two main concepts you should get familiar with in advance of the interview:
   -  Search
   -  Intelligence
  -  Using search and our intelligence features we’ll emulate a customer use case with you and ask you to demonstrate it live for us. We don’t expect you to know everything, so if you get stuck during the interview, show us how you go about researching in our docs to try and find the answer! This is as much about understanding how you approach and breakdown problems as it is getting to the correct answer. This will be followed by a short Q&A with the customer engineer to give you both a chance to get to know each other more.
  -  We’ll conduct the interview in the following format:
    -  20 minutes: live use-case demonstration
      -  The customer engineer will ask you to perform a few basic search and intelligence functions
      -  You will be sharing your screen (both the Sourcegraph public instance and our docs)
    -  15 minutes: Q&A from customer engineer to learn more about you and your capabilities
    -  10 minutes: general Q&A with customer engineer
      -  Ask anything you want! It’s your chance to learn about the team, the role, and the company from a peer!

  -  Finally, in preparation for your interview, we would like you to answer the following questions. We may drill into some of your answers as part of the 15 minute Q&A in the interview:
    -  Explain why “code reviews” are a good use-case for Sourcegraph. Explain the challenges of code-review and how Sourcegraph addresses those.
    -  Describe some security “code smells” that Sourcegraph could help find
    -  For larger deployments, Sourcegraph recommends Kubernetes as the deployment technology. Why do you think this is vs:
    -  A single Docker node
    -  Docker Compose
    -  Sourcegraph supports precise code intelligence for more accurate “Go To Definition” or “Find All References” for a symbol. Why do you think precise code intelligence will generally give better results for languages like Java or Go, vs languages like JavaScript or Python?

- Mock Meeting
  -  For this stage, we want to assess your ability to lead customer discovery, dig-deep in a customer's pain and objectives and understand their technical landscape. We also want to test your ability to understand the needs of and communicate with different levels of individuals, from developers to CTOs / Directors of Engineering. And finally, we want to test your ability to tailor your message and correlate product value to stated customer needs.
  -  The agenda for the final interview will be as follows:
  -  30 minutes discovery. The goal is to dig deep both technically and from a business perspective.
  -  15 minutes of feedback (out of role-play).

  -  To set the scene, this is some background on the fictional company you will be running the session for, and the two customer attendees:
  -  The customer is “Zoomies”, a ride-sharing company. They are an international company who make $100mn in revenue. You are talking to the dev team who are responsible for writing the ride-sharing app for customers.
  -  The two attendees are: The Director of Engineering and a Senior SRE.
  -  You know from high-level talks from the SDR that they are growing their dev team due to success in the market and expansion into new car manufacturers, but that a past security issue that made it into production code has created negative press for them.

  -  During this session there are five things we would like your discovery process to uncover from the audience:
  -  Alignment on the prospects’ business goals
  -  Identify the prospects’ pain points
  -  Uncovering their technical landscape
  -  Identify which stakeholders are detractors vs advocates
  -  At a high-level correlating Sourcegraph’s value against the customers’ needs

  -  You should expect the audience to be technical, so it is important in the final section where you are "pitching" the value of Sourcegraph back to the audience to align business value AND technical alignment.
  -  As you prepare for this it may be useful to read some of our customer case studies ( https://about.sourcegraph.com/case-studies/ ) to understand how they have solved their problems and gotten value from our products. It may also be helpful to read about our five core use cases ( https://about.sourcegraph.com/customers ).

**Product manager**

- Async writing project [(RFC Project)](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product/roles/interviews/product_manager/pm_rfc_project)
  - Interviewer(s): NA - this is a take home assignment. [Two members from the Product team](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product) will review your RFC and discuss it with you in the next round of interviews. 
  - Duration: ~1 hour
  - Details: This is a take home writing assignment to see how you communicate and think about product problems. Below is the prompt on the project. [Here's how we will measure the project](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product/roles/interviews/product_manager/pm_rfc_project): 
   - Please write a Request for comments (RFC) in a Google Doc for a recent problem you identified, solved, and shipped (the project is complete). The RFC should communicate how this problem ties to the product vision for your product/product area.
   - It should have our standard RFC structure from the handbook, or see the RFC template: Background, Problem, Proposed solution, and Definition of success. However, our handbook states that the precise format is not as important as the content itself, so feel free to improve upon this format as necessary.
   - Aim for about one page of writing (don’t go over two pages) with standard styling. This is long enough to give us the signal we want, while at the same time is short enough that you don’t experience “writer’s block” and can write it in one sitting. We expect this to take you ~1 hour.
   - What’s important is that the writing is clear and easy to understand. It should show us that you care about your writing by making conscious decisions of what to leave in or out, paying attention to grammar and spelling, and phrasing things in an understandable way.
    - The challenge is to explain something to a reader that doesn’t have the same context as you have, just like you would in a proposal for a new feature.

- Product interview
  - Interviewer(s): [Product Manager and a Product Designer](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product) who were not the reviewers of the RFC. 
  - Duration: 1 hour
  - Details: In this interview, you will review your RFC and deep dive on how you work as a product manager. Be prepared to discuss the actual proposal, what happened and what you could have done differently. We will be looking for how you use data to drive decisions and get buy-in from collaborators. How you have created solutions for customers, representing their voice across the organization. We will have about product development prioritization, and how you balance priorities of what our customers want with Engineering resources. 

- Engineering collaboration
  - Interviewer(s): Engineering Manager.
