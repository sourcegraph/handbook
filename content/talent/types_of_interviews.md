# Types of interviews

The below information is intended to help our candidates prepare for each step of the interview. Please note that the example questions are **examples only** and may not be the exact questions asked in the actual interview process.

## The interview process

Our hiring managers work with their [assigned recruiter](./index.md#talent-team-members) to create an optimal interview plan for their role. Below is an example. All steps in bold are strongly encouraged.

All role-specific interview processes are documented at the end of each [job description](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91).
We strive for consistency across all interviews.

- **Recruiter screen**
- **Hiring manager screen**
- Assignment, if applicable
- In-depth Interview stage:
  - Resume deep dive
  - Assignment review/working session, if applicable
  - Technical interview, if applicable
  - **Cross-functional team collaboration interview**
  - **Peer interview**
  - Leadership interview
  - **Values interview**
- Reference checks / offer

## Structured interview questions

We ask structured questions for all interviews, meaning that all candidates are asked the same questions in an effort to reduce bias and to even the playing-field. The interview [may be recorded](./hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire.md) so that we can focus on the candidate, not taking notes, and ensure that we're delivering a great interview experience. If a candidate prefers not to be recorded during the interview, they can let us know - the structure of the interview and decision-making process will remain the same and the decision not to be recorded will have no weight on their candidacy.

# Universal interviews

All departments are likely to have some or all of the below universal interview stages:

## Recruiter screen

- Interviewer: the assigned recruiter for the role.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Details: the goal of the recruiter screen is to learn more about your background and interest in Sourcegraph. In addition to learning about you, the Recruiter will also tell you about Sourcegraph, the role, compensation/benefits, the interview process, and answer any questions you have.
- Example questions:
  - Tell me about your work experience, past to present.
  - Why are you looking for something new?
  - Why are you interested in Sourcegraph and our open position?
  - What are you looking for in your next role, and what are you career goals?
  - Do you have overlap with a specific timezone? (only applicable for roles that have time zone requirements)
  - Tell us how much exposure, if any, you have had working with teammates across time zones. How did you stay connected and up-to-date with your team?
  - What is your ideal start date?
  - Are your compensation expectations in line with our compensation range, which is XYZ?
  - What questions do you have for us?

## Hiring Manager screen

- Interviewer: the hiring manager.
- Duration: 30-minutes is average, but sometimes these are longer.
- Details: during this stage in the interview process, the Hiring Manager will introduce themself, get to know you, and answer any initial questions you may have. This stage is meant to be conversational and informative for both us and the candidate.
- Example questions:
  - What did you do to prepare for this conversation?
  - Why do you want to be a [role title]? What are your longterm goals?
  - How would you explain what Sourcegraph does to a friend?

## Resume deep dive

- Interviewer(s): the hiring manager or a peer leads the Resume deep dive, and sometimes there is another teammate who shadows the interview.
- Duration: 60-minutes.
- Details: a resume deep dive (often referred to as a "Topgrade Interview") is an interview style where we take a deep dive into a candidate's background, past to present. The goal of a resume deep dive is to uncover the motivation behind a candidate's decision making, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments in past roles. [Here](https://www.lever.co/blog/topgrading-interview-guide/) is a document to help guide expectations on this stage in the interview process. This is simply an example of what to expect, and does not represent the questions we will be asking.
- Example questions:
  - How did you find your job? Why did you choose to accept it?
  - Who hired you? What was their name? What did they hire you to do?
  - Why would your former boss say were your strengths and opportunities for growth?
  - What did you like most and least about your job?
  - What would your peers say about you?
  - What are you most proud of accomplishing while in your job?
  - Why did you leave?

## Peer interview

- Interviewer(s): the other members of the team for which you're interviewing.
- Duration: 30-45 minutes.
- Details: during the peer interview, your potential future colleagues will assess if you will be a value-add to the team, take and give constructive criticism, and be an overall supportive team member. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions directed to your potential future peers.
- Example questions:
  - Tell us about the best team you've ever been a part of.
  - Tell us about a time when you had to put your team's interests above your own.

## Cross-functional team collaboration interview

- Interviewer(s): people outside of your respective department who you would cross-collaborate with regularly.
- Duration: 30-60 minutes.
- Details: during this stage of the interview process, you will meet with members of another team with whom you would partner regularly. The goal of this interview is to understand how you communicate and collaborate with cross-functional partners within Sourcegraph.
- Example questions:
  - Tell us about a recent project you worked on where you collaborate with people outside of your department
  - Tell me about a project where you or your team had a disagreement with someone in another function

## Leadership interview

- Interviewer: a member of the leadership team for the department.
- Duration: 30-45 minutes.
- Details: during this stage in the interview process, a member of the leadership team for the department will ask questions to gain more insight into the following areas: your grit, curiosity, passion, growth mindset, intelligence, and values. They will also answer any final questions you may have! This is generally the last stage in our interview process.
- Example questions:
  - Coming soon

## Values interview

Read more about our values interview [here](./hiring/evaluating_values.md).

- Interviewers: two teammates outside of the department for which you're interviewing.
- Duration: 30-minutes.

## Administrative

- Executive Business Partner working session scenario

  - Interviewer(s): Kacie Jenkins, Gregg Stone, and Kelsey Nagel
  - Duration: 60-minutes.
  - Details: The goal of this working session is to give us all a sense of what it would be like to work together. Below is a hypothetical situation that we would like to play out during this 60-minute session.

    You are new to the role (30 days) when Kacie and Gregg ask you to meet and discuss organizing an in-person event for the sales/marketing teams. The idea behind this event is to build strong relationships among team members and align on goals.

    Your objective in this meeting is to:

  1.  Gather all the information that you need in order to be successful at planning and executing this event.
  2.  Provide recommendations, share potential ideas, and discuss solutions with Kacie and Gregg.

  Our advice:

  - Don't go overboard on preparation or detail.
  - Clever ideas are awesome and appreciated.
  - We are also looking for your process/framework/principles.
  - If you need to take notes, we usually use Google Docs!

  Some background info:

  - Team org: [Sales team](../sales/index.md) and [Marketing team](../marketing/index.md)
  - [Publicly referenceable customer logos](https://about.sourcegraph.com/customers/)
  - Everything at [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) and our [handbook](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com) should be assumed to be accurate and up to date.

  A few pointers:

  - Ask identifying questions about existing gaps on the team
  - Be ready to identify immediate solutions
  - Be prepared to have a dynamic conversation to uncover nuances about the teams you will be working with

## BizOps, Finance, Legal, TechOps

- BizOps: Director of Data & Analytics take-home project
  - It’s 2021, and Sourcegraph is growing at a rapid pace. With the launch of Sourcegraph cloud and significant growth in sales of the existing self-hosted deployment option, the VP of Operations is asking you to prepare a plan for upgrading our data infrastructure to be prepared for the next several years of growth.
  - We have a complex user journey that can touch a number of websites, apps, and integrations:
  - Data sources:
  - Websites
  - About.sourcegraph.com: Sourcegraph’s marketing website (pages include: a splash homepage, our blog, about us, contact us, press, careers, terms of service, etc.)
  - Learn.sourcegraph.com (learning and tutorials about code search)
  - Docs.sourcegraph.com (documentation)
  - Custom SEO landing pages
  - And more...
  - Core products:
  - Sourcegraph.com: The cloud product, used for searching across the universe of open source code and users’ private repositories. Can be used as an actual product destination or simply as a demo as needed.
  - Self-hosted Sourcegraph instances: Self-hosted webapps, using the same codebase as Sourcegraph.com, but deployed on-premises or in our customers’ private clouds. An example would be Uber’s private Sourcegraph instance—only accessible to Uber employees and contractors, and only containing Uber’s code. It would be accessible to Uber devs on an internal-only domain, like sourcegraph.uber.com.
  - Integrations:
  - Sourcegraph browser extensions: Chrome, Safari, and Firefox extensions that add Sourcegraph features to other websites where users view code (e.g. enhanced code views on sites like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and more).
  - Sourcegraph editor extensions: downloadable plugins for desktop code editors, such as VS Code, Atom, and Vim, that add some Sourcegraph features locally.
  - Key notes:
  - The expectation for privacy is much higher for our downloaded products and self-hosted Sourcegraph instances. E.g. the customers who opt to host Sourcegraph themselves expect us not to track their users’ actions. Instead, we only collect aggregated telemetry from self-hosted Sourcegraph instances, with no individual user-level details.
  - Consumers of this user journey data include nearly every part of the company, from product (core app engagement and product usage data), engineering (application performance data), marketing and sales (top of funnel data and user engagement data for outreach), customer success (customer health and engagement), and more.
  - Our current traffic is ~100k monthly website visitors and cloud product users and ~40k monthly self-hosted instance users.
  - Deliverables:
  - Please design a high-level, conceptual data pipeline that would serve our business’s needs. Please name specific recommended tools (or options) to serve at each step of the pipeline. No need to write descriptions of every step, but please be prepared to answer questions about them.
  - Please describe the basic structure of data at the beginning(s) and the end(s) of the pipeline, and be prepared to discuss the data transformations that take place along the way.
  - Finally, please draw or describe (no real data required) the dashboards or reports that you would recommend providing to the CEO, the head of Product, and the head of Marketing each month.
  - We recommend that you spend approximately 2 hours on this case study. Please feel free to reach out with any questions!
- BizOps: Product Analyst take-home project
  - This exercise should take 2-3 hours to complete;please don’t take more than that!
  - Getting setup: You’ll be using Mode Analytics public datasets tocomplete this take-home project. Here are the steps to getting into the SQL workspace:
  - 1.Create an account if you don’t already have one
  - 2.Click the green+in the top right (‘Create report’)to access the workspace
  - 3.We’ll be using the following Mode Public Warehousetables to complete the exercise:tutorials.playbook_users,tutorials.playbook_events,tutorials.playbook_experiments,tutorials.playbook_emails
- Prompt: For each of the following questions please create charts and/or tables (within Mode orby exporting to a spreadsheet tool if that’s easier)to show your findings. We’re not expecting a slide deck or document to explain your findings, but quick summaries of charts, if needed, are just fine. Keep in mind that in most cases there are no “right” or “wrong” answers; we’re more interested in your approach and thought processes.

  - 1.What company is most engaged with the product?
  - 2.We ran an A/B test (experiment) to increase ‘like_message’actions users are taking. Which variant would you recommend going forward with, if any?
  - When you’ve completed the project, share your results via static run links along with some availability you have over the next week to review the project with a BizOps team members. When reviewing, you can expect questions about your approach in getting to know the data, the process you took to findthe results, results themselves, and how you decidedto communicate your findings.

- Legal: Corporate & Legal Counsel take-home project

  - The goal of the assignment is to give you a chance to demonstrate how you think, write, and negotiate while tackling issues that are top of mind for Sourcegraph and our customers.
  - Please see the attached MSA redlines (we will provide this to you if you get to this stage in the process) from our prospective customer, a CA-based tech company. Deal summary:
  - On-premise instance
  - 100K USD ACV
  - Will you respond to the redlines and include comments to the customer explaining your reasoning for any redlines that you reject or modify? Please accept any redlines that you suggest that we agree to with a brief comment explaining why.
  - In addition, please draft a short, casual note with your assessment that you would send to the account executive. Include a short issues list, with the prioritization of issues made clear.

- TechOps: Tech Ops IT Engineer take-home project / Technical Interview
  - The technical interview should be approximately:
  - 25 min for questions from Nicky and Dan M
  - 10 min questions from you to us
  - 10 min to discuss a short take-home project (3 min presentation and 7 min discussion)
  - Project:
  - We have a fully remote team. Tech Ops wants to ensure that our Team Members are appropriately protected from security threats. As part of the onboarding process we want to provide all new hires with a Security Checklist. What would you put on this checklist?
  - Please be prepared to present this recommendation on a detailed level in 3 minutes.

## Customer Support

### Collaboration and communication skills

Similar to the general peer interview (you will talk to a member of the support team), but with a specific focus. The purpose of this conversation is to get a sense of how they approach collaboration and communication. We look for someone who can collaborate equally well with customers (software engineers) and teammates in any role (from sales to product), is able to modify collaboration and communication methods depending on who they are working with/talking to, and who is adept at communicating about complex things in a way that is easy to understand.

### Technical knowledge and troubleshooting skills

Similar to the general peer interview (you will talk to a member of the support team), but with a specific focus. The purpose of this conversation is to get a sense of how they approach technical troubleshooting. We look for someone who is very curious, more of a problem solver than a builder, who can truly hit the ground running, and once onboarded requires very little assistance from engineering.

## Customer Engineering (IC)

### Hiring Manager Interview

During this interview you will meet with the hiring manager on the Customer Engineering team. They will seek to gain an understanding of your customer-facing experience. Specifically, what if any, is your experirence in a pre-sales and / or post-sales role as well as what your career aspirations are. You will have an opportunity to ask any questions about the team, role, company, or product.

### Take Home & Live Interview with a Customer Engineer

For this interview we want to give candidates an opportunity to learn about our product and assess your capabilities working in the developer tooling ecosystem! Sourcegraph has a public version of our product available [here](https://sourcegraph.com/search) to let users get a sense of product capabilities - it’s connected to public Github repositories. We’ll use this instance to guide the project portion of the interview which will be conducted live, via Zoom, with a customer engineer on the team.

There are two main concepts you should get familiar with in advance of the interview:

- [Search](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search)
- [Intelligence](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence)

Using search and our intelligence features we’ll emulate a customer use case with you and ask you to demonstrate it live for us. We don’t expect you to know everything, so if you get stuck during the interview, show us how you go about researching our docs to try and find the answer! This is as much about understanding how you approach and breakdown problems as it is getting to the correct answer.

The live project demonstration will be followed by a short Q&A with the customer engineer to give you both a chance to get to know each other more, and you’ll discuss your take home questions (see below) and answers together.

Finally, prior to this interview, we would like you to answer the following questions. Please submit your answers to these back to us. We will review your answers as part of the 15 minute Q&A in the interview:

1. Explain how Sourcegraph can improve code review flows for dev teams. Explain the challenges of code-review and how Sourcegraph addresses those.
2. What are 3 examples of something a developer can search for in sourcegraph that would help them make their code more secure
3. How can Sourcegraph help reduce the time to onboard a new dev?

We’ll conduct the interview in the following format:

- 20 minutes: live use-case demonstration
  - The customer engineer will ask you to perform a few basic search and intelligence functions
  - You will be sharing your screen (both the Sourcegraph public instance and our docs)
- 15 minutes: Q&A from customer engineer to learn more about you and your capabilities and discuss your take home answers
- 10 minutes: general Q&A with customer engineer
  - Ask anything you want! It’s your chance to learn about the team, the role, and the company from a peer!

### Working Session: Customer Scenarios Interview, Live Working Session Instructions

For this interview round, you will have an hour-long working session with a Customer Engineer on the team and one of the CE leaders. This working session is intended to help us understand how you approach customers and customer meetings. The working session will cover 4 prompts, spending approximately 10-12 minutes on each of them. It is recommended you take time to prepare in advance based on the details below.

A summary of the 4 prompts are provided below:

1. **Preparing for a customer call:** See below for some meeting notes taken by your Account Executive (AE) from an initial meeting with a prospect. The AE is requesting that you prepare a demo. Based on the notes provided: what would your demo agenda be, what would your talking points be during it, what questions do you still have for the AE and / or the customer, what additional information do you need, what would be your ideal next step after that meeting and how do you get there?
2. **Discovery during a customer call:** See below for some high-level information about a prospect put together by a Sales Development Rep (SDR). They are requesting that you and an AE join them on a second conversation with the Director of Developer Productivity and several IC engineers. What are some things you’d want to uncover during that next meeting, what would you ask, what would you share, what in your mind is the overall goal of that meeting?
3. **Dealing with detractors:** Your AE is asking you to join a meeting with a prospective customer. The AE has met with the prospect a couple times and the initial feedback you’re hearing from the AE is that the prospect isn’t seeing the value in Sourcegraph and does not feel like it’s compelling enough for them to consider at this time given other priorities they have. How do you handle this situation? What’s your game plan with your AE for that meeting?
4. **Managing customer expectations and internal handling:** You are working with a customer during a trial and they are running into an issue trying to set up one of their code hosts. How would you handle this situation? What do you say to your customer? Who internally do you engage? What if you learn that what they are trying to do is actually a feature request; how does that change your approach?

The agenda for the meeting will go as follows:

- 0-2 mins: Intros and recap of this interview stage
- 2-14 mins: Prompt 1
- 14-26 mins: Prompt 2
- 26-38 mins: Prompt 3
- 38-50 mins: Prompt 4
- 50-60 mins: Feedback and Q&A

**Important Note**: Keeping the timing of the interview will be your responsibility. If you’re running out of time on a prompt, it is better to wrap up the most salient points, and move on to the next prompt. It is important that 10 minutes be left at the end for feedback.

Finally, as you prepare for this it may be useful to read some of our [customer case studies](https://about.sourcegraph.com/case-studies/) to understand how they have solved their problems and found value from our products. It may also be helpful to read about our [five core use cases](https://about.sourcegraph.com/customers).

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prompt #1: AE Notes</span>**

1. Current team size:
   - 200 engineers. Linkedin only shows 43 as many engineers are coming from acquired software companies. This will help accelerate their development, goal is to improve their customer experience of their betting platform.
   - 100% growth in last year
   - 50% growth next year
2. Why Anything (where is the need from)?
   - They are acquiring companies to grow (new markets, products), this has resulted in them having to manage more code hosts and on board devs at 100% growth rates. Cross repo changes are key as they grow. They now use local IDEs + GitHub and GitLab search, no cross host search
   - Efficiency is poor, devs keep writing new code rather than reusing what they have access to - need to be more efficient
   - Errors are creeping - i.e.they made a recent Redis configuration change and did not apply it to all the relevant files, it is difficult to see everywhere the changes are need to be made
3. Why Sourcegraph and why now?
   - They have lots of new engineers via acquisitions, they bring in new code on different hode costs. They need a tool for ensuring everyone understand the code across all code hosts
   - They have three code-hosts: 2 GitLabs, 1 GitHub

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prompt #2: SDR Notes</span>**

A prospect (Director of Developer Productivity) came in last year and talked to the previous VP of Sales. Her team was given a license key for trial but COVID hit and the trial was put on pause. They currently have a free version but need to scale their users.

- **Use case:** primary use case is search and then Batch Changes. She wants 2 sets of users. Power users group with Enterprise features mostly search and batch and 2nd group just for daily users using search and intel. Roughly around 250 devs
- **Codehost**: Primarily GitLab but they have GitLab as well just for open source projects
- **# of repos:** 1500 (most of them not active) 300 active. 350,000 LOC for 5 repos
- **LOC**: Roughly 3-4M
- **Lang**: Go (adding more Go into their coe base), Python 60%, JS 20% and PHP, Kotlin, and Swift rest 20%
- **Architecture**: microservices.
- **Deployment setup**: Kubernetes
- **Timeline**: no timeline but the sooner they can start a POC the better

The technical champion said there aren’t any initiatives driving this re-engagement but they‘ve wanted this tool for the longest time. The biggest thing she wants to walk away with is that we can accommodate the 2 sets of user groups: power users, and daily users. She wants to understand pricing, and what next steps would be towards a more formal trial of our Enterprise product.

## Customer Engineering (Manager + Director)

### Hiring Manager Screen

During this stage of the interview, you will meet with the hiring manager. During this conversation they'll seek to understand both your exposure to a technical product and audiences and how you lead in a fast-growth organization.

### Cross-Functional Collaboration with a Peer

You'll meet with a potential peer in an adjacent team with whom we want to understand how you build relationships and partner with other leaders and how you manage across adjacent teams.

### Leadership & Team Management with 2 IC CEs

You'll meet with two individual contributors on the CE team to learn about how you build relationships within a team and how you lead, mentor, and develop others.

### Working Session: Leadership Scenarios Interview, Live Working Session Instructions

For this interview round, you will have an hour-long working session with the Customer Engineering leadership team. This working session is intended to help us understand how you approach both organizational and customer scenarios as a leader. The working session will cover 4 prompts, spending approximately 10-12 minutes on each of them. It is recommended you take time to prepare in advance based on the details below.

A summary of the 4 prompts are provided below:

1. Account/Deal Review: Two core responsibilities of this role are to perform regular reviews of your team’s book of business and making technical/strategic suggestions to unblock issues that arise. How will you go about performing such reviews with the members of your team? What are your expectations during these reviews; for net new prospects, for existing customers with upcoming renewals? From your past experiences, what do you expect your team to provide to you and on what cadence? Where is this information stored / maintained? If, on a net new deal, you uncover a deal-blocking technical requirement that we cannot fully meet, how do you handle that with your CE? With adjacent teams?

2. Escalation Handling: You are receiving feedback from cross-functional leaders that there are concerns about one of your employees. Their paired Account Executive is requesting to be assigned with a new CE stating that they feel they are not able to progress deals forward due to lackluster performance by the CE during calls and demos. How do you handle this situation? What do you share with the CE? How would you understand if the CE needs to make changes? How would you work with them to improve performance and what would you do if you do not see the improvements you expect?

3. Change Management: We are in a hyper-growth phase and there are several key initiatives that will likely be rolling out over the course of the next several quarters. A key responsibility of this role is to align and train your team, introduce, implement, and manage organizational change, and anticipate emerging needs to iterate quickly. One such initiative we expect to need to implement across the CE organization in the near future is introducing a subset of individuals with the technical skills to be able to test/validate customer edge cases prior to progressing a deal forward. This is outside the current CE responsibilities today and Product and Engineering believe that this is best served from within CE as the team responsible for the technical success of the customer. See below for more context on this prompt. How would you approach this change with your team? How will you uncover and handle objections from within the team? What will you do personally to oversee this broad initiative?

4. Your 30-60-90 Day Plan: What would your personal 30 / 60 / 90 day plan be for joining the team as a leader? What would you personally need to ensure success executing against this 30 / 60 / 90 day plan? How will you communicate and ensure alignment with our leadership team during your 30 / 60 / 90 day plan?

The agenda for the meeting will go as follows:

- 0-2 mins: Intros and recap of this interview stage
- 2-14 mins: Prompt 1
- 14-26 mins: Prompt 2
- 26-38 mins: Prompt 3
- 38-50 mins: Prompt 4
- 50-60 mins: Feedback and Q&A

Important Note: Keeping the timing of the interview will be your responsibility. If you’re running out of time on a prompt, it is better to wrap up the most salient points, and move on to the next prompt. It is important that 10 minutes be left at the end for feedback. You are more than welcome to use slides to faciliate this conversation or personal notes - whichever you feel is most appropriate.

Prompt 3 additional notes:
The [CE](../ce/index.md) organization is pre- and post-sales oriented to the overall technical success of our customers: from the initial deal through our long term engagement. The types of activities that we perform as part of our core responsibilities are described [here](../ce/working-with-customers.md). These activities align with traditional Sales Engineering, Solution Architecture, and Technical Account Management organizational responsibilities because we essentially wear all of these hats. How we currently interact with other teams is described [here](../ce/team-culture.md#how-we-intersect-other-teams). As the team accountable for our customers’ technical success we recognize the need to inspect opportunities from the lens of technical requirements aligning with our product and to validate edge cases or customer-specific requirements. We expect that a new, dedicated sub-team will work with the account CE to perform these technical validation steps.

- Product Marketing Manager working session
- Duration: 60-minutes.
- The goal of the working session is to give us all a sense of what it'd be like to work together and make sure we have a shared understanding of the role and goals. This is not meant to be stressful or require a lot of preparation.
- First, we'd like to cover some general stuff:
  - Your 20-second Sourcegraph pitch: Imagine a senior eng at your current company asked you what Sourcegraph is. We don't expect this to be super polished or even 100% correct - we want to hear your spin on what we're selling and the value proposition.
  - What do you need to be successful? (tools, resources/special budget for anything, specific commitments from other teams, anything from me, etc.)
- Then we'd like to hear, at a high level, how you would approach putting together a GTM plan for the [TBD Product] GA launch.
- This could easily take several hours, but we're just looking for a 60-min conversation total (including the general stuff above). _You don't need to put together a full plan!_
- Please don't go overboard on preparation, plans, or detail. Clever ideas are awesome, but we're looking for your process/framework/principles. A Google Doc outline is how we'd do this kind of thing internally, so that's best. Doesn't have to be pretty. If you prefer slides, that's fine. This will be a casual back and forth conversation; not a formal presentation.
- Feel free to reach out to Andy with any questions.

- Senior Customer Marketing Manager working session

  - Then, we’d like to hear your ideas for how we can drive engagement with our Customer Advisory Board members in-between meetings in order to provide even more value for members.
  - Please don't go overboard on preparation, plans, or detail. Clever ideas are awesome, but we're also looking for your process/framework/principles. A Google Doc outline is how we'd do this kind of thing internally, so that's best. Doesn't have to be pretty. If you prefer slides, that's fine. This will be a casual back and forth conversation; not a formal presentation. You’ll also have an opportunity to ask the team questions during this portion.

  - Part 2: Setting you up for success
  - Then, you’ll meet 1:1 with Andy where you’ll have a chance to discuss the role and share what you need to be successful: tools, resources/special budget for anything, specific commitments from other teams, anything from Andy, etc.)

- Async writing project [(RFC Project)](../product-engineering/product/roles/interviews/product_manager/pm_rfc_project.md)

  - Interviewer(s): NA - this is a take home assignment. [Two members from the Product team](../product-engineering/product/index.md) will review your RFC and discuss it with you in the next round of interviews.
  - Duration: ~1 hour
  - Details: This is a take home writing assignment to see how you communicate and think about product problems. Below is the prompt on the project. [Here's how we will measure the project](../product-engineering/product/roles/interviews/product_manager/pm_rfc_project.md):
  - Please write a Request for comments (RFC) in a Google Doc for a recent problem you identified, solved, and shipped (the project is complete). The RFC should communicate how this problem ties to the product vision for your product/team.
  - It should have our standard RFC structure from the handbook, or see the RFC template: Background, Problem, Proposed solution, and Definition of success. However, our handbook states that the precise format is not as important as the content itself, so feel free to improve upon this format as necessary.
  - Aim for about one page of writing (don’t go over two pages) with standard styling. This is long enough to give us the signal we want, while at the same time is short enough that you don’t experience “writer’s block” and can write it in one sitting. We expect this to take you ~1 hour.
  - What’s important is that the writing is clear and easy to understand. It should show us that you care about your writing by making conscious decisions of what to leave in or out, paying attention to grammar and spelling, and phrasing things in an understandable way.
  - The challenge is to explain something to a reader that doesn’t have the same context as you have, just like you would in a proposal for a new feature.

- Product interview

  - Interviewer(s): [Product Manager and a Product Designer](../product-engineering/product/index.md) who were not the reviewers of the RFC.
  - Duration: 1 hour
  - Details: In this interview, you will review your RFC and deep dive on how you work as a product manager. Be prepared to discuss the actual proposal, what happened and what you could have done differently. We will be looking for how you use data to drive decisions and get buy-in from collaborators. How you have created solutions for customers, representing their voice across the organization. We will have about product development prioritization, and how you balance priorities of what our customers want with Engineering resources.

- Engineering collaboration
  - Interviewer(s): Engineering Manager.
  - Duration: 30 min
  - Details: In this interview, you will meet with the Engineering Manager from the team you’re interviewing for, your counterpart in the PM-EM responsibilities. We will be evaluating how you collaborate and work within a team, specifically how you partner with Engineering to drive the product vision of your team. We will focus on your technical background, as you will need to be able to discuss the technical aspects of our product with customers and communicate feedback and technical insight to the team. It is important that you demonstrate enthusiasm and understanding for the product and problem space, identifying and communicating the pain that Sourcegraph solves for developers.

**Product designer**

- Portfolio review

  - Interviewer(s): [Two Product Designers](../product-engineering/product/index.md).
  - Duration: 1 hour

  - The interview is in 2 parts. Below is the prompt:
  - Part 1: (~15 min) Pick a developer application (e.g., code hosts like GitHub or GitLab, cloud providers like AWS or GCP, monitoring tools like Lightstep or Sentry, etc) and walk us through what works well and what doesn’t. We do not want you to prepare a presentation or script, but should come knowing which application you want to use as an example and be prepared to have a conversation about it.
  - Part 2: (~60 min) We will give you a specific problem to solve for Sourcegraph and would like you to walk us through your design process.
