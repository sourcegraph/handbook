# Types of interviews

The below information is intended to help our candidates prepare for each step of the interview. Please note that the example questions are **examples only** and may not be the exact questions asked in the actual interview process.

## The interview process

Our hiring managers work with their [assigned recruiter](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent#talent-team-members) to create an optimal interview plan for their role. Below is an example. All steps in bold are strongly encouraged.

All role-specific interview processes are documented at the end of each [job description](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91).
We strive for consistency across all interviews.

- **Recruiter screen**
- **Hiring manager screen**
- Assignment, if applicable
- In-depth Interview stage:
  - Resume deep dive
  - Assignment review/working session, if applicable
  - Technical interview, if applicable
  - **Cross-team collaboration interview**
  - **Peer interview**
  - Leadership interview
  - **Values interview**
- Reference checks / offer

## Structured interview questions

We ask structured questions for all interviews, meaning that all candidates are asked the same questions in an effort to reduce bias and to even the playing-field. The interview [may be recorded](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire) so that we can focus on the candidate, not taking notes, and ensure that we're delivering a great interview experience. If a candidate prefers not to be recorded during the interview, they can let us know - the structure of the interview and decision-making process will remain the same and the decision not to be recorded will have no weight on their candidacy.

# Universal interviews

All departments are likely to have some or all of the below universal interview stages:

## Recruiter screen

- Interviewer: the assigned recruiter for the role.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Details: the goal of the recruiter screen is to learn more about your background and interest in Sourcegraph. In addition to learning about you, the Recruiter will also tell you about Sourcegraph, the role, compensation/benefits, the interview process, and answer any questions you have.
- Example questions:
  - Tell me about your work experience, past to present.
  - Why are you looking for something new?
  - Why are you interested in Sourcegraph and our open position?
  - What are you looking for in your next role, and what are you career goals?
  - Do you have overlap with a specific timezone? (only applicable for roles that have time zone requirements)
  - Tell us how much exposure, if any, you have had working with teammates across time zones. How did you stay connected and up-to-date with your team?
  - What is your ideal start date?
  - Are your compensation expectations in line with our compensation range, which is XYZ?
  - What questions do you have for us?

## Hiring Manager screen

- Interviewer: the hiring manager.
- Duration: 30-minutes is average, but sometimes these are longer.
- Details: during this stage in the interview process, the Hiring Manager will introduce themself, get to know you, and answer any initial questions you may have. This stage is meant to be conversational and informative for both us and the candidate.
- Example questions:
  - What did you do to prepare for this conversation?
  - Why do want to be a [role title]? What are your longterm goals?
  - How would you explain what Sourcegraph does to a friend?

## Resume deep dive

- Interviewer(s): the hiring manager or a peer leads the Resume deep dive, and sometimes there is another teammate who shadows the interview.
- Duration: 60-minutes.
- Details: a resume deep dive (often referred to as a "Topgrade Interview") is an interview style where we take a deep dive into a candidate's background, past to present. The goal of a resume deep dive is to uncover the motivation behind a candidate's decision making, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments in past roles. [Here](https://www.lever.co/blog/topgrading-interview-guide/) is a document to help guide expectations on this stage in the interview process. This is simply an example of what to expect, and does not represent the questions we will be asking.
- Example questions:
  - How did you find your job? Why did you choose to accept it?
  - Who hired you? What was their name? What did they hire you to do?
  - Why would your former boss say were your strengths and opportunities for growth?
  - What did you like most and least about your job?
  - What would your peers say about you?
  - What are you most proud of accomplishing while in your job?
  - Why did you leave?

## Peer interview

- Interviewer(s): the other members of the team for which you're interviewing.
- Duration: 30-45 minutes.
- Details: during the peer interview, your potential future colleagues will assess if you will be a value-add to the team, take and give constructive criticism, and be an overall supportive team member. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions directed to your potential future peers.
- Example questions:
  - Tell us about the best team you've ever been a part of.
  - Tell us about a time when you had to put your team's interests above your own.

## Cross-team collaboration interview

- Interviewer(s): people outside of your respective department who you would cross-collaborate with regularly.
- Duration: 30-45 minutes.
- Details: during this stage of the interview process, you will meet with members of another team with whom you would partner regularly. The goal of this interview is to understand how you communicate and collaborate with cross-functional partners within Sourcegraph.
- Example questions:
  - Tell us about a recent project you worked on where you collaborate with people outside of your department
  - Tell me about a project where you or your team had a disagreement with someone in another function

## Leadership interview

- Interviewer: a member of the leadership team for the department.
- Duration: 30-45 minutes.
- Details: during this stage in the interview process, a member of the leadership team for the department will ask questions to gain more insight into the following areas: your grit, curiosity, passion, growth mindset, intelligence, and values. They will also answer any final questions you may have! This is generally the last stage in our interview process.
- Example questions:
  - Coming soon

## Values interview

Read more about our values interview [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/evaluating_values).

- Interviewers: two teammates outside of the department for which you're interviewing.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Details: this interview is focused entirely on our values and how a candidate's views and experiences align with them. Our values are key to our success as individuals and as a company. You can read more about them [here](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/values).
- Example questions:
  - We will ask behavioral-based, open-ended questions directly related to our values.

# Department specific interviews

In addition to the above interviews, some departments have department-specific interviews.

## Administrative

- Executive Business Partner working session scenario

  - Interviewer(s): Kacie Jenkins, Katerina Nikolova, Gregg Stone, and Kelsey Nagel
  - Duration: 60-minutes.
  - Details: The goal of this working session is to give us all a sense of what it would be like to work together. Below is a hypothetical situation that we would like to play out during this 60-minute session.

    You are new to the role (30 days) when Kacie and Gregg ask you to meet and discuss organizing an in-person event for the sales/marketing teams. The idea behind this event is to build strong relationships among team members and align on goals.

## BizOps, Finance, Legal, TechOps

- BizOps: Director of Data & Analytics take-home project
  - It’s 2021, and Sourcegraph is growing at a rapid pace. With the launch of Sourcegraph cloud and significant growth in sales of the existing self-hosted deployment option, the VP of Operations is asking you to prepare a plan for upgrading our data infrastructure to be prepared for the next several years of growth.
  - We have a complex user journey that can touch a number of websites, apps, and integrations:
  - Data sources:
  - Websites
  - About.sourcegraph.com: Sourcegraph’s marketing website (pages include: a splash homepage, our blog, about us, contact us, press, careers, terms of service, etc.)
  - Learn.sourcegraph.com (learning and tutorials about code search)
  - Docs.sourcegraph.com (documentation)
  - Custom SEO landing pages
  - And more...
  - Core products:
  - Sourcegraph.com: The cloud product, used for searching across the universe of open source code and users’ private repositories. Can be used as an actual product destination or simply as a demo as needed.
  - Self-hosted Sourcegraph instances: Self-hosted webapps, using the same codebase as Sourcegraph.com, but deployed on-premises or in our customers’ private clouds. An example would be Uber’s private Sourcegraph instance—only accessible to Uber employees and contractors, and only containing Uber’s code. It would be accessible to Uber devs on an internal-only domain, like sourcegraph.uber.com.
  - Integrations:
  - Sourcegraph browser extensions: Chrome, Safari, and Firefox extensions that add Sourcegraph features to other websites where users view code (e.g. enhanced code views on sites like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and more).
  - Sourcegraph editor extensions: downloadable plugins for desktop code editors, such as VS Code, Atom, and Vim, that add some Sourcegraph features locally.
  - Key notes:
  - The expectation for privacy is much higher for our downloaded products and self-hosted Sourcegraph instances. E.g. the customers who opt to host Sourcegraph themselves expect us not to track their users’ actions. Instead, we only collect aggregated telemetry from self-hosted Sourcegraph instances, with no individual user-level details.
  - Consumers of this user journey data include nearly every part of the company, from product (core app engagement and product usage data), engineering (application performance data), marketing and sales (top of funnel data and user engagement data for outreach), customer success (customer health and engagement), and more.
  - Our current traffic is ~100k monthly website visitors and cloud product users and ~40k monthly self-hosted instance users.
  - Deliverables:
  - Please design a high-level, conceptual data pipeline that would serve our business’s needs. Please name specific recommended tools (or options) to serve at each step of the pipeline. No need to write descriptions of every step, but please be prepared to answer questions about them.
  - Please describe the basic structure of data at the beginning(s) and the end(s) of the pipeline, and be prepared to discuss the data transformations that take place along the way.
  - Finally, please draw or describe (no real data required) the dashboards or reports that you would recommend providing to the CEO, the head of Product, and the head of Marketing each month.
  - We recommend that you spend approximately 2 hours on this case study. Please feel free to reach out with any questions!
- BizOps: Product Analyst take-home project
  - This exercise should take 2-3 hours to complete;please don’t take more than that!
  - Getting setup: You’ll be using Mode Analytics public datasets tocomplete this take-home project. Here are the steps to getting into the SQL workspace:
  - 1.Create an account if you don’t already have one
  - 2.Click the green+in the top right (‘Create report’)to access the workspace
  - 3.We’ll be using the following Mode Public Warehousetables to complete the exercise:tutorials.playbook_users,tutorials.playbook_events,tutorials.playbook_experiments,tutorials.playbook_emails
- Prompt: For each of the following questions please create charts and/or tables (within Mode orby exporting to a spreadsheet tool if that’s easier)to show your findings. We’re not expecting a slide deck or document to explain your findings, but quick summaries of charts, if needed, are just fine. Keep in mind that in most cases there are no “right” or “wrong” answers; we’re more interested in your approach and thought processes.

  - 1.What company is most engaged with the product?
  - 2.We ran an A/B test (experiment) to increase ‘like_message’actions users are taking. Which variant would you recommend going forward with, if any?
  - When you’ve completed the project, share your results via static run links along with some availability you have over the next week to review the project with a BizOps team members. When reviewing, you can expect questions about your approach in getting to know the data, the process you took to findthe results, results themselves, and how you decidedto communicate your findings.

- Legal: Corporate & Legal Counsel take-home project

  - The goal of the assignment is to give you a chance to demonstrate how you think, write, and negotiate while tackling issues that are top of mind for Sourcegraph and our customers.
  - Please see the attached MSA redlines (we will provide this to you if you get to this stage in the process) from our prospective customer, a CA-based tech company. Deal summary:
  - On-premise instance
  - 100K USD ACV
  - Will you respond to the redlines and include comments to the customer explaining your reasoning for any redlines that you reject or modify? Please accept any redlines that you suggest that we agree to with a brief comment explaining why.
  - In addition, please draft a short, casual note with your assessment that you would send to the account executive. Include a short issues list, with the prioritization of issues made clear.

- TechOps: Tech Ops IT Engineer take-home project / Technical Interview
  - The technical interview should be approximately:
  - 25 min for questions from Nicky and Dan M
  - 10 min questions from you to us
  - 10 min to discuss a short take-home project (3 min presentation and 7 min discussion)
  - Project:
  - We have a fully remote team. Tech Ops wants to ensure that our Team Members are appropriately protected from security threats. As part of the onboarding process we want to provide all new hires with a Security Checklist. What would you put on this checklist?
  - Please be prepared to present this recommendation on a detailed level in 3 minutes.

## Customer Support

- Customer Support Manager
  - Direct Report Interview
  - During this stage of the interview process, we will get an understanding of your leadership capabilities
  - Example questions:
  - Tell us about how you created trust with your last team
  - Tell us what you do when someone makes a mistake
  - Technical Savvy Interview
  - During this stage of the interview process, we will discuss our product, customers, and technology and determine if you will be effective in a technology leadership role.

## Customer Engineering

- Customer Engineer Take Home & Live Project Interview

  - For this interview we want to give you an opportunity to learn about our product! Sourcegraph has a public version of our product available here to let users get a sense of product capabilities - it’s connected to public Github repositories. We’ll use this instance to guide the project portion of the interview which will be conducted live, via Zoom, with a customer engineer on the team.
  - There are two main concepts you should get familiar with in advance of the interview:
  - Search
  - Intelligence
  - Using search and our intelligence features we’ll emulate a customer use case with you and ask you to demonstrate it live for us. We don’t expect you to know everything, so if you get stuck during the interview, show us how you go about researching in our docs to try and find the answer! This is as much about understanding how you approach and breakdown problems as it is getting to the correct answer. This will be followed by a short Q&A with the customer engineer to give you both a chance to get to know each other more.
  - We’ll conduct the interview in the following format:
  - 20 minutes: live use-case demonstration
  - The customer engineer will ask you to perform a few basic search and intelligence functions
  - You will be sharing your screen (both the Sourcegraph public instance and our docs)
  - 15 minutes: Q&A from customer engineer to learn more about you and your capabilities
  - 10 minutes: general Q&A with customer engineer
  - Ask anything you want! It’s your chance to learn about the team, the role, and the company from a peer!

  - Finally, in preparation for your interview, we would like you to answer the following questions. We may drill into some of your answers as part of the 15 minute Q&A in the interview:
  - Explain why “code reviews” are a good use-case for Sourcegraph. Explain the challenges of code-review and how Sourcegraph addresses those.
  - Describe some security “code smells” that Sourcegraph could help find
  - For larger deployments, Sourcegraph recommends Kubernetes as the deployment technology. Why do you think this is vs:
  - A single Docker node
  - Docker Compose
  - Sourcegraph supports precise code intelligence for more accurate “Go To Definition” or “Find All References” for a symbol. Why do you think precise code intelligence will generally give better results for languages like Java or Go, vs languages like JavaScript or Python?

- Mock Meeting

  - For this stage, we want to assess your ability to lead customer discovery, dig-deep in a customer's pain and objectives and understand their technical landscape. We also want to test your ability to understand the needs of and communicate with different levels of individuals, from developers to CTOs / Directors of Engineering. And finally, we want to test your ability to tailor your message and correlate product value to stated customer needs.
  - The agenda for the final interview will be as follows:
  - 30 minutes discovery. The goal is to dig deep both technically and from a business perspective.
  - 15 minutes of feedback (out of role-play).

  - To set the scene, this is some background on the fictional company you will be running the session for, and the two customer attendees:
  - The customer is “Zoomies”, a ride-sharing company. They are an international company who make $100mn in revenue. You are talking to the dev team who are responsible for writing the ride-sharing app for customers.
  - The two attendees are: The Director of Engineering and a Senior SRE.
  - You know from high-level talks from the SDR that they are growing their dev team due to success in the market and expansion into new car manufacturers, but that a past security issue that made it into production code has created negative press for them.

  - During this session there are five things we would like your discovery process to uncover from the audience:
  - Alignment on the prospects’ business goals
  - Identify the prospects’ pain points
  - Uncovering their technical landscape
  - Identify which stakeholders are detractors vs advocates
  - At a high-level correlating Sourcegraph’s value against the customers’ needs

  - You should expect the audience to be technical, so it is important in the final section where you are "pitching" the value of Sourcegraph back to the audience to align business value AND technical alignment.
  - As you prepare for this it may be useful to read some of our customer case studies ( https://about.sourcegraph.com/case-studies/ ) to understand how they have solved their problems and gotten value from our products. It may also be helpful to read about our five core use cases ( https://about.sourcegraph.com/customers ).

### Working Session: Customer Scenarios Interview, Live Working Session Instructions

For this interview round, you will have an hour-long working session with a Customer Engineer on the team and one of the CE leaders. This working session is intended to help us understand how you approach customers and customer meetings. The working session will cover 4 prompts, spending approximately 10-12 minutes on each of them. It is recommended you take time to prepare in advance based on the details below.

A summary of the 4 prompts are provided below:

1. **Preparing for a customer call:** See below for some meeting notes taken by your Account Executive (AE) from an initial meeting with a prospect. The AE is requesting that you prepare a demo. Based on the notes provided: what would your demo agenda be, what would your talking points be during it, what questions do you still have for the AE and / or the customer, what additional information do you need, what would be your ideal next step after that meeting and how do you get there?
2. **Discovery during a customer call:** See below for some high-level information about a prospect put together by a Sales Development Rep (SDR). They are requesting that you and an AE join them on a second conversation with the Director of Developer Productivity and several IC engineers. What are some things you’d want to uncover during that next meeting, what would you ask, what would you share, what in your mind is the overall goal of that meeting?
3. **Dealing with detractors:** Your AE is asking you to join a meeting with a prospective customer. The AE has met with the prospect a couple times and the initial feedback you’re hearing from the AE is that the prospect isn’t seeing the value in Sourcegraph and does not feel like it’s compelling enough for them to consider at this time given other priorities they have. How do you handle this situation? What’s your game plan with your AE for that meeting?
4. **Managing customer expectations and internal handling:** You are working with a customer during a trial and they are running into an issue trying to set up one of their code hosts. How would you handle this situation? What do you say to your customer? Who internally do you engage? What if you learn that what they are trying to do is actually a feature request; how does that change your approach?

The agenda for the meeting will go as follows:

- 0-2 mins: Intros and recap of this interview stage
- 2-14 mins: Prompt 1
- 14-26 mins: Prompt 2
- 26-38 mins: Prompt 3
- 38-50 mins: Prompt 4
- 50-60 mins: Feedback and Q&A

**Important Note**: Keeping the timing of the interview will be your responsibility. If you’re running out of time on a prompt, it is better to wrap up the most salient points, and move on to the next prompt. It is important that 10 minutes be left at the end for feedback.

Finally, as you prepare for this it may be useful to read some of our customer case studies([https://about.sourcegraph.com/case-studies/](https://about.sourcegraph.com/case-studies/)) to understand how they have solved their problems and found value from our products. It may also be helpful to read about our five core use cases ([https://about.sourcegraph.com/customers](https://about.sourcegraph.com/customers)).

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prompt #1: AE Notes</span>**

1. Current team size:
   - 200 engineers. Linkedin only shows 43 as many engineers are coming from acquired software companies. This will help accelerate their development, goal is to improve their customer experience of their betting platform.
   - 100% growth in last year
   - 50% growth next year
2. Why Anything (where is the need from)?
   - They are acquiring companies to grow (new markets, products), this has resulted in them having to manage more code hosts and on board devs at 100% growth rates. Cross repo changes are key as they grow. They now use local IDEs + GitHub and GitLab search, no cross host search
   - Efficiency is poor, devs keep writing new code rather than reusing what they have access to - need to be more efficient
   - Errors are creeping - i.e.they made a recent Redis configuration change and did not apply it to all the relevant files, it is difficult to see everywhere the changes are need to be made
3. Why Sourcegraph and why now?
   - They have lots of new engineers via acquisitions, they bring in new code on different hode costs. They need a tool for ensuring everyone understand the code across all code hosts
   - They have three code-hosts: 2 GitLabs, 1 GitHub

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prompt #2: SDR Notes</span>**

A prospect (Director of Developer Productivity) came in last year and talked to the previous VP of Sales. Her team was given a license key for trial but COVID hit and the trial was put on pause. They currently have a free version but need to scale their users.

- **Use case:** primary use case is search and then Batch Changes. She wants 2 sets of users. Power users group with Enterprise features mostly search and batch and 2nd group just for daily users using search and intel. Roughly around 250 devs
- **Codehost**: Primarily GitLab but they have GitLab as well just for open source projects
- **# of repos:** 1500 (most of them not active) 300 active. 350,000 LOC for 5 repos
- **LOC**: Roughly 3-4M
- **Lang**: Go (adding more Go into their coe base), Python 60%, JS 20% and PHP, Kotlin, and Swift rest 20%
- **Architecture**: microservices.
- **Deployment setup**: Kubernetes
- **Timeline**: no timeline but the sooner they can start a POC the better

The technical champion said there aren’t any initiatives driving this re-engagement but they‘ve wanted this tool for the longest time. The biggest thing she wants to walk away with is that we can accommodate the 2 sets of user groups: power users, and daily users. She wants to understand pricing, and what next steps would be towards a more formal trial of our Enterprise product.

  - Interviewer(s): NA - this is a take home assignment. [Two members from the Product team](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product) will review your RFC and discuss it with you in the next round of interviews.
  - Duration: ~1 hour
  - Details: This is a take home writing assignment to see how you communicate and think about product problems. Below is the prompt on the project. [Here's how we will measure the project](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/product/roles/interviews/product_manager/pm_rfc_project):
  - Please write a Request for comments (RFC) in a Google Doc for a recent problem you identified, solved, and shipped (the project is complete). The RFC should communicate how this problem ties to the product vision for your product/product area.
  - It should have our standard RFC structure from the handbook, or see the RFC template: Background, Problem, Proposed solution, and Definition of success. However, our handbook states that the precise format is not as important as the content itself, so feel free to improve upon this format as necessary.
  - Aim for about one page of writing (don’t go over two pages) with standard styling. This is long enough to give us the signal we want, while at the same time is short enough that you don’t experience “writer’s block” and can write it in one sitting. We expect this to take you ~1 hour.
  - What’s important is that the writing is clear and easy to understand. It should show us that you care about your writing by making conscious decisions of what to leave in or out, paying attention to grammar and spelling, and phrasing things in an understandable way.
  - The challenge is to explain something to a reader that doesn’t have the same context as you have, just like you would in a proposal for a new feature.
