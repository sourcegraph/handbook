# The values interview

We expect every teammate, team, and our company to live up to the [Sourcegraph values](../../company/values.md). It is therefore important that we evaluate every candidate on the values to determine how successful they will be within Sourcegraph. Because of this, **all candidates,** regardless of level or role, go through a [values interview](../types_of_interviews.md#values-interview) as part of their interview process with Sourcegraph.

## What is the values interview?

- Interviewers: two teammates outside of the department for which a candidate is interviewing.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Details: this interview is focused entirely on our values and how a candidate’s views and experiences align with them. Our values are key to our success as individuals and as a company. You can read more about them [here](../../company/values.md).

## Who is eligible to lead a values interview

All teammates who have been at Sourcegraph for 3+ months are eligible to conduct a values interview.

## How do I conduct a values interview?

The purpose of the values interview is to determine if the candidate embodies and exemplifies our values.  It is not meant to be a skill assessment, and should only focus on Sourcegraph's values. One member of the values team will opt in as a lead (this person is the one who begins the introduction and asks the first question), and then you will alternate asking questions with the other member of the values team.

You can see more information about our interview stages [here](../types_of_interviews.md)

**Part 1**: Introduce yourself, build rapport, and set agenda

Sample script: Hi [candidate name], thank you so much for joining us today!  We know you have been through several other stages of the interview process, and everyone has really enjoyed getting to know you thus far.  For the next 30-minutes, we're excited to spend time together discussing our values, which we believe are the principles and beliefs that help us achieve our goals and vision.  We'd like to start with introductions.  We will then ask a series of questions related to our values, and we'll be sure to leave 5-10 minutes at the end for questions from you.  Does this sound good?

- 1st interviewer: my name is [name], my role is [position], and I have been at Sourcegraph for [length of time].
- 2nd interviewer: my name is [name], my role is [position], and I have been at Sourcegraph for [length of time].

You can find the above information in the "interview prep" section of your Greenhouse scorecard.

**Part 2**: Ask structured, behavioral-based interview questions

- Your stuctured interview questions can be found in your Greenhouse scorecard
- Your goal is to assess whether or not the candidate aligns with our values only. This is **not a skills assessment** for the role.
- Please make sure the interview is recorded by pressing "Record with Brighthire."  (Recording an interview is not required but we encourage it. To learn more about why we record our interviews and why it helps provide a fair, inclusive, and enjoyable interview experience, [click here](./guide_to_using_brighthire.md).
- Be sure to ask "drill down questions" and continue to ask more specific open ended "tell me..." questions to dig deeper and fully understand the candidate's response before moving forward to the next question. Some examples of "drill down questions" include:
  - "Tell us why you made that decision"
  - "Tell us what you would have done differently"
  - "Tell us how you implemented that feedback moving forward"

**Part 3**: Answer candidate questions, sell, and end on a positive note!

- Tell them why you love Sourcegraph!
- We are transforming the world by making it so that everyone can code.
- We are a handbook-first company, and lead with transparency.
- We have experience tremendous revenue growth.
- We have incredible leadership who set the example for trust and open communication.
- We have endless growth opportunities and we invest in our employees' professional development.

**Part 4**: Provide feedback

- Please fill out your Greenhouse Scorecard following the interview.
- To ensure that bias doesn't impact your decision-making, please be sure to fill out your scorecard before discussing with anyone.
- To learn more about providing feedback, [click here](../interview_process.md#providing-interview-feedback).

# Resources for recruiters

Please ask the Hiring Manager if they have any suggestions for their role.
Reminders:

- Must have been here for 3+ months. Here is a [doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUDEjzud_GxocjKkd__m0hTf21tN3OIgOwtk_OjhV20/edit?ts=60e4c3bd#gid=0) that lists everyone who has been here for 3+ months.
- Must be two people from different departments
- Please keep diversity in mind when selecting teams

Once the values team has been selected, the Recruiter is responsible for sending a Slack to each values team saying:

"Hi team! As you know, our [values interview](./evaluating_values.md) is critical to ensuring that our new hires embody our values, and we need your help! The two of you have been nominated to serve as the values team for our [role title] opening. I recognize that this is outside of your day-to-day responsibilities, so please let me know if you're willing to participate (and if you're too busy right now, no worries! We can always add you to another team when your schedule allows). If you both agree to opt in, below are some helpful details:

- The two of you will conduct a 30-minute values interview for all [role title] finalists. We anticipate 3-5 total interviews (so this would be a 1.5-2.5 hour commitment) and will be spread out over multiple days.
- One of you will need to opt in as the lead (this person is the one who begins the introduction and asks the first question).
- [Here](./evaluating_values.md) is a resource to help you in the interview.
- All structured interview questions are listed in your Greenhouse scorecard, found in the interview prep link in your interview calendar invite.

Please let me know if this is something you're both willing to participate in and I'll add you to the interview plan. And if you have any questions or would like to practice in advance of the interview, let me know and I'll send a calendar invite!"
