# LinkedIn hiring manager seats

## Overview

LinkedIn's guide to hiring manager seats [here](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/learning-center/tip-sheets/en-us/AccessUseYourHiringMgrSeat.pdf).

## How to get a hiring manager seat assigned

1. Add your Sourcegraph email to your LinkedIn profile.
2. Message @hiring or recruiting@sourcegraph.com to assign you a hiring manager seat. Please include details of which role your are hiring for and set up time to create a search string for the role.

## Hiring manager seat capabilities

1. Viewing and reviewing candidates in a project you are added to.
2. Viewing candidates that applied or are apply starters (LinkedIn's term for candidates that clicked the apply button, but may not have actually applied).

## Search filters

Work with the recruiter to create search criterias for your role. This will be used to generate an automated pipeline of outbound candidates for the hiring manager to review.

LinkedIn's guide to their search filter for recruiter seat can be found [here](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/learning-center/tip-sheets/en-us/HowSearchFiltersWork.pdf).

Common filters used:

- Job titles: Common industry titles the role has.
- Keywords: Skills or phrases found on profiles of interest. Qualification section of job description is a good source for keywords.
- Location: Any preference on location or time zone for the role.
- Companies: Any companies that are known to have quality candidates for the role.
- Years of experience: Possible minimum years of experience required for the role, or is commonly needed to gain the required qualifications.

## Engagement strategy

Before a project is set up and you are added to a project, there won't be any actions to take with the hiring manager seat.

After the hiring manager and recruiter work together on setting up the search criteria, LinkedIn will surface batches of candidates that meet that criteria for the hiring manager to review. The hiring manager and recruiter will set up an outreach strategy for profiles we want to engage. This will likely be the recruiter finding the candidate's email if possible for the hiring manager to outreach, or the recruiter sending an InMail to set up an intro call with the hiring manager.

Only candidates we decide to engage will be added into Greenhouse.
