## Onboarding process for US-based employees & contractors

After the candidate formally signs the offer letter via DocuSign (or PEO documentation if onboarding via PEO), the Recruiter takes the following steps to onboard the new Teammate:

Step 1: via Greenhouse, **the Recruiter** sends a welcome email to the candidate by selecting the `"welcome email from recruiter - US"` or the `"welcome email from recruiter - Non-US"`template, depending on the location of the new Teammate.

- To: the Candidate
- CC: Recruiting@sourcegraph.com, Onboarding@sourcegraph.com, Hiring Manager
- This should be sent within 24-hours of acceptance.

Step 2: **the Recruiter** confirms that the open, start and hired dates are correct, ensuring accurate time-to-fill data.
