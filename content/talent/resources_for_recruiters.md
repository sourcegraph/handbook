## Intake Call Guidelines

Hiring managers are required to have an intake meeting with their respective Recruiter before beginning the candidate search. In an ideal world, the intake meeting should be scheduled after the Hiring Manager has completed the [intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYwWlI_4bKKSkhWq4FrLNE2MPEhRtiq91GtEC6RuFAt-mgfA/viewform) and the Recruiter has reviewed this information.

The intake meeting is intended for the Hiring Manager and the Recruiter to get on the same page about job requirements, the ideal candidate, and the proposed interview process.

**Step 1:** Please use the below checklist to ensure you cover the necessary topics during the intake meeting. You can also review the [intake form response](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dpf6aDw1ESJRYroJz6-ZtaACJxwjEu4my_xeYuB3a7E/edit#gid=2123710308) on our Open Job Report.

**Step 2:** Please review the [interview plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMG_K3pf_pP_AIvy8jjOKc-h6htDJ5QkvEMD3prAQ5Y/edit#gid=1808593536) and ensure all interview sections are completed and consistent with our [Types of Interviews](./types_of_interviews.md).

In addition to reviewing these topics during the intake meeting, the Recruiter and the Hiring Manager will select the [Values Interview](./hiring/evaluating_values.md) Panel. Using [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUDEjzud_GxocjKkd__m0hTf21tN3OIgOwtk_OjhV20/edit?ts=60e4c3bd#gid=0), the Recruiter and the Hiring Manager select two people who are highlighted in green (indicating that they have been here for 3 months or longer). When choosing two people to be on the Values Interview, please keep in mind the following:

- must have been here for 3+ months
- must be two people from different departments
- please keep diversity in mind when selecting teams

Once the Recruiter and the Hiring Manager have identified the interviewers, the Recruiter will ensure they are trained & ready to go!

## **Slack Kick-Off Process**

Once the Recruiter has conducted an intake call and the interview plan is complete, the Recruiter officially kicks off the role in Slack.

1. Create a new channel slack channel named: “team-hiring_position_recruiter-name”
   1. Example: “ops-hiring_handbook-product-manager_recruiter-kelsey”
2. Invite the entire interview panel plus VP Talent & Recruiting Coordinator to the channel
3. Tag VP Talent to make the channel private
4. Once private, send kick off note using the below template:

Hi team! We are excited to kick off our [hyperlink job description] opening and I appreciate all of you participating in the interview process. I thought it would be helpful to create a Slack channel to stay aligned as we begin interviewing candidates!

## LinkedIn posting best practices

Instead of resharing a post, it is much better to copy and paste the entire post and then give the author credit by tagging them.

Avoid including links directly in your posts. Anything that takes the user away from LinkedIn is discouraged... so instead, add the link as a comment.

If you're looking for Sourcegraph content to promote to your network, view the "Recommendations from Sourcegraph" section on [Sourcegraph's LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sourcegraph). There you will find recent updates and articles.

Sourcegraph will share the top priority roles we're hiring for via a monthly LinkedIn and Twitter post. It is encouraged to post about our open roles on personal Linkedin profiles as well. Thank you for helping us attract and hire the best talent!
