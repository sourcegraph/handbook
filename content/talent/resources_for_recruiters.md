## Intake Call Guidelines

Hiring managers are required to have an intake meeting with their respective Recruiter before beginning the candidate search. In an ideal world, the intake meeting should be scheduled after the Hiring Manager has completed the [intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYwWlI_4bKKSkhWq4FrLNE2MPEhRtiq91GtEC6RuFAt-mgfA/viewform) and the Recruiter has reviewed this information.

The intake meeting is intended for the Hiring Manager and the Recruiter to get on the same page about job requirements, the ideal candidate, and the proposed interview process.

**Step 1:** Please use the below checklist to ensure you cover the necessary topics during the intake meeting. You can also review the [intake form response](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dpf6aDw1ESJRYroJz6-ZtaACJxwjEu4my_xeYuB3a7E/edit#gid=2123710308) on our Open Job Report.

**Step 2:** Please review the [interview plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMG_K3pf_pP_AIvy8jjOKc-h6htDJ5QkvEMD3prAQ5Y/edit#gid=1808593536) and ensure all interview sections are completed and consistent with our [Types of Interviews](./types_of_interviews.md).

In addition to reviewing these topics during the intake meeting, the Recruiter and the Hiring Manager will select the [Values Interview](./hiring/evaluating_values.md) Panel. Using [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUDEjzud_GxocjKkd__m0hTf21tN3OIgOwtk_OjhV20/edit?ts=60e4c3bd#gid=0), the Recruiter and the Hiring Manager select two people who are highlighted in green (indicating that they have been here for 3 months or longer). When choosing two people to be on the Values Interview, please keep in mind the following:

- must have been here for 3+ months
- must be two people from different departments
- please keep diversity in mind when selecting teams

Once the Recruiter and the Hiring Manager have identified the interviewers, the Recruiter will ensure they are trained & ready to go!

## **Slack Kick-Off Process**

Once the Recruiter has conducted an intake call and the interview plan is complete, the Recruiter officially kicks off the role in Slack.

1. Create a new channel slack channel named: “team-hiring_position_recruiter-name”
   1. Example: “ops-hiring_handbook-product-manager_recruiter-kelsey”
2. Invite the entire interview panel plus VP Talent & Recruiting Coordinator to the channel
3. Tag VP Talent to make the channel private
4. Once private, send kick off note using the below template:

Hi team! We are excited to kick off our [hyperlink job description] opening and I appreciate all of you participating in the interview process. I thought it would be helpful to create a Slack channel to stay aligned as we begin interviewing candidates!

As a next step, please:

  - Attendees: Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate.
  - Prior to the call, Recruiter drafts an Offer Summary and sends to VP Talent and Hiring Manager confirming the offer details are correct, and outlining the agenda for the call.
  - Agenda: 1. the Hiring Manager kicks off the call to give the candidate feedback and tell why we’re excited about them 2. the Recruiter then shares their screen to display the offer summary document. The Recruiter then covers our compensation philosophy, the compensation specifics, perks, travel (and benefits, if applicable), and equity 3. the Hiring Manager and Recruiter answers any questions and asks how the candidate is feeling about the opportunity.
  - Before ending the call, be sure to determine a potential start date (all start dates should fall on a cohort Monday) and 2) schedule a follow up call to answer any questions.
- Following the offer call, Recruiter sends the offer summary to the candidate in an email.
- To send an official offer, the Recruiter
  - 1.  updates the offer approval with the accurate start date
  - 2.  tags the VP Talent and the Recruitment Operations Specialist in the notes section: "@Carly @Trevor please send this [US/Non-US] offer letter"
- The official offer is sent to the candidate via Docusign.

## After the offer

- After the candidate signs the offer, the Recruiter sends a welcome email to the candidate and Cc's the Hiring Manager.
- The Hiring Manager posts an announcement of the candidate's acceptance in the Slack #Hiring channel.
- The Recruiter declines all other candidates, marks the candidate as "Hired" in Greenhouse, closes the job (if applicable), sends a hire report to Ines, VP of Talent, and Hiring Manager, and exports the candidate to Bamboo.
- The People Operations team then works with the candidate to onboard them and get them set up for their first day.

## LinkedIn posting best practices

It is much better to copy and paste the entire post and then give the author credit by tagging them. Long story short, avoid resharing and copy/paste instead.

Avoid including links directly in your posts. Anything that takes the user away from LinkedIn is discouraged... so instead, add the link as a comment.
