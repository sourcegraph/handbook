### Candidate experience 

We know that interviewing can be stressful and that a lot of time and energy is spent as you go through the process. We are committed to providing a world-class candidate experience, so if there's anything we can do to make your experience more enjoyable, please feel free to email recruiting@sourcegraph.com.  You can also provide anonymous feedback in the candidate survey sent via Greenhouse after you are 1) declined or 2) sign your offer. 

Specifically, we aim to provide a positive candidate experience by...

- Treating all candidates with respect at all stages, regardless of hiring outcome.
- Writing our job descriptions as clearly as possible to ensure you have a good understanding of the job and the impact you would make in the role. All job descriptions are written in an [inclusive format](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/interview_process#creating-a-job-description), encouraging candidates from all walks of life to apply. 
- Ensuring that our interview process is structured, that all interview questions [are planned](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/interview_process#creating-an-interview-plann) in advance of all interviews.
- [Recording our interviews](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire) to ensure we are focused on what you are saying, and not on taking notes.  
- Providing candidates with the tools to be successful in an interview, including transparency around our [interview process](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/interview_process), information about what to expect at a given [stage of the interview](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/types_of_interviews), and resources on [how to prepare](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/how_to_prepare_for_candidates) for the interview.
- Offering clear, honest and consistent communication throughout all stages of the interview process.  We try our best to get back to you quickly and will never waste your time if we know we're not moving you forward in our process.
- Maintaining a respectful process for rejecting job applicants who do not move forward in the interview process or receive an offer.
- Smoothly transitioning new hires into the onboarding process.

### Respecting time

Interviewing requires time and effort, both for Sourcegraph teammates and for our candidates. The hiring manager is responsible for monitoring feedback during the interview phase, and if it becomes obvious that we won't be moving forward with a candidate, then the hiring manager should cancel any remaining interviews to be respectful of both the candidate's and interviewers' time.

### Policy for candidates re-applying to roles

Candidates are welcome to re-apply for roles at any time. The talent team will review all relevant information, including past interview feedback, when considering a person's candidacy.

# How to prepare for an interview 

We know that interviewing can be stressful, so we want to provide you as much information as possible to help you feel prepared.  If we are missing any advice or resources that would be helpful, please email recruiting@sourcegraph.com.   

### Zoom 

We leverage Zoom for our video interviews. Please make sure to test Zoom prior to the interview to ensure you don't have any technical difficulties.

### Interview recording 

We believe that candidates should be assessed based on merit, not our memory. Our interview recording tool, [BrightHire](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire), allows us to revisit key details, revise initial impressions, and replace implicit bias with explicit evidence. It brings structure and consistency to each interview and ensures that every candidate gets the opportunity they deserve.

1) We record our interviews so we can focus on the conversation, not taking notes, and run a better hiring process.
2) Memory recall actually declines to 44% one hour after an interview. We want to make sure that we are basing our hiring decisions on your merit, and not our memory.
3) BrightHire allows us to run a more equitable process by ensuring that all candidates are given the same questions and experience. Rather than requiring perfect recall or notes, it will allow hiring managers to refer back to specific questions and answers, and to triangulate perspectives using concrete examples.
4) BrightHire also ensures your interviews are structured and well thought out, giving you the best opportunity to showcase your relevant experience and qualifications.
5) If you speak with multiple interviewers, BrightHire will help the hiring team coordinate to give you a great experience. It’ll be much less likely you’ll be asked to “Tell me about yourself” four times in four interviews.

Using BrightHire is optional for both our interviewers and our candidates. We will only record interviews with a candidate’s explicit consent and you can choose to opt out at any time. If you do opt out, please let us know prior to the interview by emailing recruiting@sourcegraph.com. The structure of the interview and decision process will remain the same and their decision will have no weight on your candidacy.
