## Kicking off a new search

The below actions must take place before we begin interviewing candidates.

Step 1: The **Hiring Manager** sends a Slack #Hiring to confirm your role is in the board-approved headcount plan and to confirm which Recruiter will be working on your search.

Step 2: The **Hiring Manager** creates a job description & interview plan using [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJAYyARbegvvH_e-VTrHoFhU9cDG5WfHov3L12NeCO8/edit). We recognize that this step is time consuming, yet it is a critical step in setting our search up for success. Creating a well-thought out job description and interview plan 1) ensures alignment between the Hiring Manager, the hiring team, and the Recruiter and 2) ensures that all candidates are receiving a fair and consistent interview experience. Creating a strong plan upfront is also proven to reduce time-to-fill, meaning that we will make a hire faster, on average.

- **Job description format**: we write all job descriptions in an _impact format_. The way a job description is written can plan a key role in promoting positive Diversity & Inclusion efforts. Countless studies have shown that certain demographics are less likely than others to apply if they don’t meet 100% of the outlined qualifications. To that end, Sourcegraph's job description format focuses on the **impact** a candidate will make in the role versus a long list of requirements that have historically impeded underrepresented candidates from applying, resulting in a larger and more diverse candidate pool. The goal of the job description is to focus on getting the candidate excited, while giving a clear representation on what we expect them to accomplish both in the short-term and longer-term. How will working out Sourcegraph benefit them in their career? Why is this the best job they’ll ever have?

- **Interview plan format**: creating a structured interview process is critical to our DEI efforts. Research shows that structured interviews are up to **twice as effective** at predicting job performance than unstructured ones, and ultimately help us hire faster. Structuring interviews with a standardized set of questions also allows for a more fair and impartial way of assessing candidates, which helps remove unconscious biases. Before creating your interview plan, you may find it helpful to read about the [types of interviews](./types_of_interviews.md) other hiring managers have leveraged in the past. When creating the interview questions, please keep in mind: all interview questions should be written in open ended format (the best way to ensure of this is to start every question with “tell me…”), and to ensure all questions are legal, ask yourself “does this question relate to the candidate’s ability to do this job?” … if you can’t confidently say yes, it’s better to not ask it!

Step 3: The **Hiring Manager** fills out [this intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ju9waV4k_TpYMGmYZaH5eA2swkuvIthLFKQCzqrRUZM/edit). Responses are routed to our [headcount tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dpf6aDw1ESJRYroJz6-ZtaACJxwjEu4my_xeYuB3a7E/edit#gid=2123710308).

_Once the Hiring Manager completes the above steps, the Recruiter takes the below actions:_

Step 1: the **Recruiter** schedules a 30-minute intake meeting with the Hiring Manager to kick off the search and review the responses to the intake form & review the job description and interview plan. This is a necessary step to ensure initial alignment and set our search up for success.

- **Intake Call Guidelines:** Hiring managers are required to have an intake meeting with their respective Recruiter before beginning the candidate search. In an ideal world, the intake meeting should be scheduled after the Hiring Manager has completed the [intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYwWlI_4bKKSkhWq4FrLNE2MPEhRtiq91GtEC6RuFAt-mgfA/viewform) and the Recruiter has reviewed this information. The intake meeting is intended for the Hiring Manager and the Recruiter to get on the same page about job requirements, the ideal candidate, and the proposed interview process. Please use the below checklist to ensure you cover the necessary topics during the intake meeting. You can also review the [intake form response](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dpf6aDw1ESJRYroJz6-ZtaACJxwjEu4my_xeYuB3a7E/edit#gid=2123710308) on our [Open Job Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dpf6aDw1ESJRYroJz6-ZtaACJxwjEu4my_xeYuB3a7E/edit#gid=0).

Step 2: the **Recruiter** opens the job in Greenhouse:

- Copy the "Template" job.
- Build out the interview plan, adding all behavioral-based, structured questions (found in the [interview plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJAYyARbegvvH_e-VTrHoFhU9cDG5WfHov3L12NeCO8/edit) directly into each interview stage.
- All interview stages should use the standard interview titles, found [here](./types_of_interviews.md).

Step 3: the **Recruiter** posts the job to our [Careers page](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91). If you would like it posted in other locations, please ask your Recruiter or send a Slack message to #hiring. You can see a list of other job boards we are considering [here](hiring/job_boards.md).

Step 4: the **Recruiter** creates a Slack channel with the Interview Team and starts the Slack Kick-Off Process.

- Create a new channel slack channel named: `“team-hiring_position_recruiter-name”` Example: `“ops-hiring_handbook-product-manager_recruiter-kelsey”`
- Invite the entire interview panel plus VP Talent & Recruiting Coordinator to the channel
- Tag VP Talent to make the channel private. Once private, send kick off note using the below template:

"Hi team! We are excited to kick off our [hyperlink job description] opening and I appreciate all of you participating in the interview process. I thought it would be helpful to create a Slack channel to stay aligned as we begin interviewing candidates!
