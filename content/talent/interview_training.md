Hi everyone, my name is Carly Jones and I am the VP of talent here at Sourcegraph. I’m excited to be here today to talk about interviewing! Interview training is something that we all need - even the most experienced interviewers - because interviewing takes practice and the more we talk about it and learn from each other, the better we will all become.

Agenda:

1. We will start the training talking about unconscious bias, sometimes known as implicit bias.
2. Next, we will talk about legal do’s and don’ts in the interview process. Our goal is to ensure that all teammates are fully equipped to know what they can and cannot ask so that they feel comfortable in interviews. We want everybody in the company, regardless of level or position, to feel completely equipped to jump into an interview and support the hiring needs of Sourcegraph.
3. We're going to jump into the Values Interview. We’ve had a lot of different ways in which we've been assessing values in the past. We're now bringing it all together and making it standardized.
4. Finally, we’re going to discuss the importance of candidate experience.

A quick disclaimer as I jump in: this training is not intended only as an opportunity for me to share what I know. I am still learning and evolving, and I encourage you to identify gaps in the training and share things that we should incorporate moving forward.  
It is very important to train everybody on how to interview and best practices. Not only does it ensure a consistently positive experience for our candidates - which results in better hires - it allows us to ensure we are running an inclusive process for every candidate regardless of background. On top of that, it protects us from a legal standpoint.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(3).png>)

We recognize the need to cultivate diversity and help close the opportunity gap for job seekers. Our goal is to reduce bias and remove barriers that are built into the hiring process. In order to do so, we must be cognizant of our unconscious biases.

So what is unconscious bias? Unconscious bias, also commonly known as implicit bias, is something that we all have, so this training is not going to be about how to get rid of it. In fact, unconscious bias has been useful for many, many generations and historically. If you go back to the beginning of human time, we had unconscious bias because our bodies wanted to preserve energy to be able to escape from a saber-toothed tiger. We have an unconscious bias to be able to make really quick snap judgments about things that don't take energy and time away from being able to escape when we're in danger. That is why it exists.

We have all inherited biases through our upbringing and culture, and we are oftentimes not even aware of them. So the point of this training isn't on how to get rid of them entirely; rather, it’s to become aware of them and start to figure out some tools on how we can work towards mitigating them. In the interview process, for example, we can structure an interview process that ensures that our unconscious biases aren't impacting our ability to make an informed and fair hiring decision. We should structure our interview process in a way where candidates are given a fair and enjoyable experience, regardless of their background and our unconscious bias.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(4).png>)

Study after study has shown that culturally diverse companies are much more likely to outperform their competitors, so we want to make sure that we are building a culturally diverse team at Sourcegraph.

Unconscious biases cause us to make a snap judgment of a candidate within the first 10 seconds of meeting them. That doesn't just refer to interviewing. It can also occur when you're dealing with a customer or a peer. We use these unconscious biases to inform ourselves of decisions we're making. When conducting an interview, for example, we can make a snap judgment and spend the rest of the interview reinforcing those biases that we have. Imagine you are interviewing somebody and you see that they went to the same school as you did or they like the same sports team that you do. You may unconsciously feel an affinity towards that person because they look like you and remind you of you. In that scenario, you may spend the rest of the interview looking for signs to reaffirm that this candidate is the right fit for the job. In reality, it could be an affinity bias. As part of this training, we will discuss some ways to mitigate that bias and ensure that we're giving everybody a fair shot at getting a job, regardless of whether or not they like the same sports team as you.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(5).png>)

The first way that we can prevent unconscious bias is to take the [Harvard implicit bias test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html). I took this assessment thinking that I am neutral and I surely did not have a bias, but it exposed that I do have unconscious bias. I strongly encourage all of you to take this test if you're interested in learning more about your specific bias. It's okay that we all have these, but awareness of them should work towards reducing them to the best of our ability.

The second way to prevent unconscious bias is to consider likeability. We tend to want to hire people who remind us of ourselves. Make sure you're asking yourself, does the person I'm interviewing have the innate will, skill, and values to succeed in the role? We should not hire based on whether they grew up in the same place, have the same hobbies, etc. We really should not be leveraging those things to make a decision one way or another.

Finally, stick to an interview script. Our hiring managers work hard at the beginning of every process to create an interview plan. We're going to dig into what that looks like later on in the training, but this creates a structured interview process that every candidate goes through regardless of background and it ensures that they are all asked the exact same questions to level the playing field. Asking those structured interview questions helps to reduce bias from affecting our decision making.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(6).png>)

Research has shown, time and time again, that establishing a consistent set of interview questions and a structured process not only helps us hire people that are going to be more successful in the role, but it actually speeds up the process in which we can make a hiring decision. Even if it takes you more time to set up an interview plan, it will save you a lot of time throughout the interview process and you’ll likely have to interview fewer candidates. Since we will be more aligned on what we're looking for early on, this will allow us to make a decision and push candidates through the process faster.

All of our questions that we're building out are open ended, so they cannot be answered with a yes or no answer. The best way to create an open ended question is to just put, “tell me” in front of every single question you ask. For example, “tell me a time when, tell me how, or tell me why.” It is important to ensure they’re behavioral based questions that are specific about past experiences. This helps us predict future behavior. At Sourcegraph, we should try to avoid any hypothetical questions.

Pamela Fuller published a great book that addresses unconscious bias and how it shows up at work. It is written in an actionable way and we highly recommend that all ​​Sourcegraph teammates read it. We are thinking about how we can provide more in-depth trainings on the topics addressed in this book around unconscious bias.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(8).png>)

We’ve introduced a recording tool called [BrightHire](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire#how-our-teammates-use-brighthire) to standardize our process and reduce bias. Effectively, BrightHire rides along in your phone and Zoom interviews with an interactive notepad. All you need is the Chrome extension and Zoom and you’re all set. It allows us to pull all of those structured questions that our hiring manager created right into your Zoom meeting.

You don't need to take any notes during the interview process because BrightHire guides you and transcribes the meeting for you. You can record a plus or minus or a flag and tag somebody and get their thoughts on a specific portion of the interview. Hiring teams can refer back and review key moments to check each other’s blind spots. Along with training, this will help us to check and mitigate the unconscious biases we all bring into interviews and hiring decisions.

BrightHire increases collaboration and helps you ensure that you're sticking to those interview questions that have been pre-determined in the interview plan. The platform supports our DEI efforts by ensuring we evaluate each candidate on their own words with consistent interview criteria.

[This video](https://www.loom.com/share/8be5ba749fc045faafd577998bdeabf7) explains the benefits of BrightHire. We believe that candidates should be assessed based on their merits, not our memories. BrightHire allows us to recall key details, revise initial impressions, and replace implicit bias with explicit evidence.

With the use of BrightHire, Sourcegraph can leverage real data in order to address critical questions like candidate NPS and pass-through rates of candidates from underrepresented groups. Personalized feedback will automatically be delivered to every interviewer about how they’re running conversations. For example, BrightHire will track talk time (how much of the interview you are talking vs the candidate), longest monologue, volume, speaking rate (how fast you are talking), and interactivity (rate of conversational back-and-forth). Every BrightHire user can see their own aggregate stats and how they compare to colleagues on the Analytics tab.

We want to strive to be more listeners than talkers. So, if we see that we're talking 75% of the time as an interviewer, we need to take action by listening more. It also gives details on monologues. We want to avoid talking for multiple minutes without pausing and giving the candidate a chance to ask questions. So, we'll start getting insight, and it'll give us averages, as well as best practices so you can see what you're doing as it compares to what you should be aiming for. Speaking rate is how quickly you're talking - so again this will give us some insight into what the optimal speaking pace is. And if you're speaking too fast or too slow, it can give you analytics on that as well. Then finally, interactivity. This is measuring the back and forth with your candidate. The more interactive an interview is, the more conversational it'll feel and the more the candidate will likely be at ease. We want to see that interactivity score be relatively high.

With BrightHire, you can also search for keywords and topics that have been discussed across a number of interviews. For example, you can search times that “equity” and/or “IPO” have been discussed.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(10).png>)

Evidence suggests that memory recall of an event declines to 44% an hour after the event has concluded. Hiring managers do not always have time to submit candidate notes within that time frame. Rather than requiring perfect recall or notes, BrightHire will allow hiring managers to refer back to specific questions and answers, and to triangulate perspectives using concrete examples.

Our recruiters, confirmation templates, and interviewers need to make it clear that being recorded is optional and it will not negatively impact the hiring decision in any way. If a candidate decides to opt out of being recorded, it is all of our responsibility to still run a standardized interview process and take detailed notes. We need to be hyper vigilant that we are not being biased when assessing candidates who opt out.

Another reason why having structured interview questions is because it helps us avoid asking illegal questions. We understand that sometimes conversations can get off track, however, so we want you to be aware of the legal rules.

We trust that our team wants to be open-minded and would not intentionally discriminate when interviewing. That being said, it is important that we review the rules to make sure everyone is aware of them.

Please review [federal EEO laws](https://www.eeoc.gov/), your state’s employment laws, and your internal counsel when necessary.

Even though we're given structured questions to ask throughout the interview process, there are still going to be situations where you feel the need to ask follow up questions to drill down and get to the root of an answer. So I want to run through the following questions and clarify which are legal and illegal to ask.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(12).png>)

We cannot ask candidates where they are from. It doesn’t have anything to do with their performance on the job. If we ask that and ultimately do not hire them, they could claim that they were discriminated against.

What about asking about their hobbies or what they do in their spare time? This is something that a significant amount of interviewers ask, but it is illegal. If a candidate discloses that they go to church, for example, it exposes information about them and they then have grounds to suspect they've been discriminated against if they do not get hired.

So where do we draw the line? Oftentimes recruiters and interviewers ask, “tell me about yourself and walk me through your background.” If candidates openly share personal information after this question, the best thing to say is, “That’s interesting, thank you for sharing.” Then, redirect the conversation back to topics that directly relate to a candidate’s ability to do the job. You can ask about candidates and their background, so long as it deals with their ability to perform the duties of the role.

This is why it's crucial for us to have structured interview questions so that interviewers know exactly what they should be asking. We need to make sure that the wording is phrased in a way that is legal, open ended, and behavioral based so that there's no gray area. Questions that are illegal include, “What about your relationship? How old are your children? What does your partner do for a living?” All of these could open Sourcegraph up to a lawsuit.

What about, “Do you have a college degree?” This is legal, but it's important to note that we do not require a degree or even list a degree as a requirement for most of our positions, unless it's a specialized role such as a lawyer in the Legal Group, which may require a JD.

Although it is legal to ask about a degree, things that can get muddy. If you ask, “what year did you graduate?”, technically that's not illegal because somebody could take several years in between high school and college so it's not necessarily indicative of their age, but it gets you in a gray area. We should stay away from asking questions that could be digging into somebody's age, when they graduated, etc.

Can we ask, “what is your current compensation?” No, and this is something that we absolutely want to avoid. There are laws in most places around the world now that make it illegal for employers to ask candidates what they're currently making or what they've made in the past. This is in an effort to reduce the gender pay gap. Rather than asking what candidates make, we should ensure that we have ranges defined when we post a job. When we launch our search, we should create a level and identify a range so that we establish salary expectations with all candidates at the beginning of the process. Rather than ask what they've earned, the recruiters should ensure that they fall within our range. Nobody other than the recruiters should ask about compensation because the Talent Team is equipped and trained to ask this in a legal way. If the recruiters pass somebody to the interview process, it can be assumed that they have already covered compensation.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(13).png>)

Above is a list of topics to avoid, even if they _were_ legal. The talent team will clarify what information is needed from the hiring managers when they kick off a role. All necessary qualifications, like an advanced degree for example, will be captured on the front end so that interviewers do not have to worry about asking those types of questions.

Of course, candidates will bring up some of this information on their own without you asking. They might tell you something about their children or the fact that they just bought a house. In these instances, it is okay to respond and share something personal about yourself if you’d like. While you should try to avoid engaging in an in-depth conversation that goes in a direction that feels uncomfortable and/or illegal, you didn’t ask a direct illegal question. You cannot control what information a candidate volunteers and that is okay. What you can control is what you're asking.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(14).png>)

Candidates can say things that would be completely inappropriate or uncomfortable that you would never want to know. In these cases, politely redirect the conversation to the best of your ability. You are still protected because you did not ask for that information. But If you were to then go on and say, “Oh, tell me more”, “What do you like to do around that new house?” or “Is there a church nearby?” - that would be illegal. There is certainly a gray area and that's why we are going to structure out these questions and try to redirect these questions back to focusing on the job.

Since Sourcegraph is an all-remote company, some questions might arise around where candidates are located or whether they’ve worked remotely before. These are questions that should be covered by the talent team in the recruiter screen. By the time a candidate gets to the in-depth interview process, we should feel confident that they know that we're a remote first environment, they're comfortable with that, and we've assessed that. Any specific questions you ask need to directly relate to their ability to succeed in the role. If you ask about their ability to effectively manage teams remotely, that is okay. It’s not asking them where they live or where they’re from. It’s asking them, are you comfortable working remotely and where would you be working remotely from? You can ask them to talk to you about their experience managing teams in diverse locations or their experience working remotely in general. You can also ask if they are comfortable with a certain number of overlap in their working hours given we often work out of different timezones. Those are questions that directly relate to their ability to be successful at Sourcegraph.

Interviewing takes practice and some of these questions can get into the gray area. It's not always black and white and it can be hard. I've been interviewing for a long time and I even find myself trying to backtrack and redirect in a polite way. It takes a lot of practice and we don't always get it right, but I'm just excited that you are all invested in learning and becoming better. We'll keep pulling out resources that can help support you so that you feel safe going into interviews and providing a strong candidate experience.

The Sourcegraph workplace is a community. In any given community where people work together effectively, alignment on values is critical. That is why before we extend any offers, we have every candidate take part in a 30 minute Values Interview. I am going to explain some best practices for the values interview, which are applicable to any type of interview.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(16).png>)

Our goal is to standardize the interview process at Sourcegraph across all departments. Everything in purple is mandatory. Everything in gray is optional.

These are some pillar steps that every single candidate goes through, regardless of which position they're interviewing for. The recruiter screen is where we talk about compensation, questions around location, and conduct an overall qualification assessment to make sure that candidates are going to be a strong fit based on our alignment with the hiring manager.

We then transition to a hiring manager screen. This is normally 30 minutes. If we're doing a deep dive, sometimes it's 60 minutes.

We then transition candidates to an assessment for some roles, but not all. The talent team will work with the hiring manager to determine if there's an assessment stage and will depend on them to build it out.

Next is the in-depth interview stage. This is not standardized for all roles. One of the things we're rolling out in a kind of beta testing with some hiring managers is what's known as a resume deep dive or a topgrade. Some studies have shown that this reduces a mishire rate of over 50% down to 10%. I'll train people who are interested and then once we've tested it enough internally we can determine if it makes sense to have that be mandatory across all interviews at Sourcegraph.

You will see that our [Values Interview](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/evaluating_values) is mandatory and every single candidate, regardless of level, is going to go through it. Historically, we have assessed candidates to ensure that they're aligned with our values, but it's been ad hoc and in different ways depending on the hiring manager and the role. So we are standardizing the interview moving forward. Every candidate will be assessed for values in the exact same way, with the exact same questions.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(17).png>)

The purpose of the Values Interview is to ensure that the candidate embodies our core values. It is \_not \_a skills assessment. Rather, the goal of the interview is to determine whether candidates can positively contribute to our [core values](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/values). This is just as important as determining if they have the skill and will to perform the duties of the role.

Workplaces are a version of a community. In any community where you want people to figure out how to work together effectively, it can be helpful to have a common set of guiding principles. Understanding how intrinsically aligned a candidate might be to our guiding principles makes it more clear as to what will be easy and what will be hard for them if they come into this environment. Will they need coaching or might they be an example? I think about it as an alignment exercise to determine what they are going to add that could potentially enhance our values and take them to the next stage as our community at Sourcegraph continues to grow and evolve.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(18).png>)

Candidates are brand ambassadors, regardless of whether we hire them or not and candidate experience should be a top priority. We want to ensure we're hiring people who are going to enhance our values, and who believe in them the way that we do. On the flip side, it provides a really great candidate experience and it allows our candidates to truly realize that we don't just put values in our handbook, but we actually live them and breed them.

The Values Interview is also important for the candidate for a couple of reasons. I have worked for companies in the past where we had a Values Interview and I consistently received feedback that this is one of their favorite steps in the process. Not only does it give candidates direct exposure to our DNA, our makeup, and why our values are important - it also gives them the opportunity to meet people outside of the respective department for which they're interviewing. For example, if somebody is interviewing for a sales role, they could meet with somebody from the marketing and/or finance team. Not only does the candidate have the opportunity to see that our values are really important, but they also have the opportunity to meet a diverse set of teammates. They have the opportunity to ask why people outside of their respective departments work at Sourcegraph.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(19).png>)

We’ve all worked with people who are technically capable of doing the job that we never want to work with again. While we don't want to unconsciously hire new teammates who are clones of us, having a way of getting a signal on their values is critical. The interview ensures that we are remaining dedicated to our core values as we scale and grow. The right hires who contribute, enhance, and add to our values will positively impact the future of our business.

The Values Interview is also a great way for us as teammates to reinforce what our values are at Sourcegraph. For example, a teammate on Slack asked if we can make an acronym or backdrop to remember them. This interview will serve as one of the many ways in which we can continuously keep them top of mind and think of them without having to put them on a wall. We want to embody them and this is a great way to be talking about them a lot more regularly.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(20).png>)

Logistically, the Values Interview is 30 minutes long. We should allow five minutes for the introduction, 20 minutes for the screen, and 5 minutes at the end for questions. We ask structural, behavior based questions that are the same for every candidate. These are on our handbook so if you haven't familiarized yourself with [our values](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/values), please start to do so because we are really going to rely on our teammates to feel like they have a good understanding of all of our values and we believe that these values are what helps us achieve our goals and our vision, and ultimately build an inclusive team.

Please review [this page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/evaluating_values) in the handbook for more information.

When you get scheduled for any interview, not just the values interview, you are going to receive a calendar invitation. First and foremost, please make sure to accept it to indicate that you can attend. The worst thing that can happen is we assume you're making it because you haven't accepted or declined it, but then you do not show. We want to preserve an incredible candidate experience, so please accept to indicate that you can attend. If you cannot make it, please decline your calendar invite and message whoever sent you the invitation to let them know. If you decline the same day as the interview, please slack the #hiring channel as well and we'll find a replacement or reschedule.

Please follow the instructions on [how to download BightHire](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/hiring/guide_to_using_brighthire#how-our-teammates-use-brighthire). Once complete, to launch BrightHire from Google Calendar, you will click the “interview with BrightHire” button and it will pull up both the Zoom recording as well as your Chrome extension which will guide you through your structured questions.

The other important thing to note in the interview calendar invite is the scorecard. You are able to quickly access the candidate’s scorecard in Greenhouse by clicking on it through your invitation. We recommend that you open three tabs in Greenhouse for your interview: interview prep, job description, and the scorecard.

The first tab is the “interview prep.” This is intended to show the purpose of the respective interview. You should also open the “job details”, which will give you the job description. And then here is the scorecard, which will contain the questions that are built out by the hiring manager. You will have specific questions to ask for every single value in the values interview. These are the same questions that are displayed through BrightHire and you can click on and guide through the process that way.

![Alt Text](<https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/InterviewBasics/Sourcegraph%20Interview%20Training%20-%20Q2%20FY22%20(23).png>)

This is the ideal structure for all interviews, not just the values interview.

- Step 1: Develop rapport through introductions and set the interview agenda
- Step 2: Ask behavioral-based questions
- Step 3: Leave time to answer questions, build rapport, and sell the candidate on Sourcegraph

As we all know, interviewing can be stressful. The priority is to develop rapport, get the candidate at ease, and make them feel comfortable. We should ask them how they're doing, make sure they have a glass of water, and answer any initial questions they have. We always want to introduce ourselves and set an agenda. You could start by saying, “Here is what I hope to accomplish during the next 30 minutes. For 20 minutes, I will ask you some behavioral-based questions. Then, I will leave 5 minutes at the end to answer any questions that you have.”

The behavioral based questions should be built out ahead of time by the hiring manager. Interviewers should never be going into an interview not knowing the questions that they’re supposed to be asking. All interviewers should check their scorecard ahead of time to make sure this is the case.

Step three is to answer any questions the candidate has and then go back to rapport building and selling. Even if you don't feel like the candidate is the right fit for the role, you should still establish rapport and leave them on a high note feeling good. If you know that this is the best candidate you've talked to and you are super excited to move them forward, go into selling mode. You could say, “I'm so glad to have met you and I'm happy to be a resource as you go through the process and have any questions. It's a great place to work.” As a team, we will develop a guide of all of the selling points and how we can consistently sell Sourcegraph. We will create bullets that you can leverage to sell our company, depending on the scenario.

The only time that selling can go awry is if we give any indication that they're going to get an offer, and then they don't get an offer. We need to be careful that when we're selling, we're not saying things like, “when you join us” or “I'm so excited to work with you.” Instead, we should say, “here is why Sourcegraph is so great” or “here is why I'm so excited to be here and these are some reasons why I decided to join Sourcegraph.”

We are in a candidate driven market. I have never seen a situation where so many candidates have so many different opportunities and options to explore. We need to make sure that we give an incredible candidate experience. Candidates join companies not only for the role, but also their future managers. Do they feel a connection to the people that they're going to be reporting to? And do they feel a connection with the team with whom they're going to be working? It is all of our responsibility to ensure we're giving an experience that allows us to hire the people that we want versus losing them to other opportunities.

All questions that we ask in the Values Interview should start with “Tell me…” to ensure they are open-ended and prevent a “yes” or “no” answer. We use the interview funnel for each question, as follows: we start with an open ended question, narrow down to a specific area and listen for how the candidate goes about it, discover the candidate’s motivations, listen for the candidate’s achievements, then summarize the answer back to the candidate and seek agreement (see chart).

Best practices:

- We may need to dig deeper and drill down to determine whether candidates embody a specific value, but interviewers can still phrase questions as “tell me”
- Remind candidates that they can pause if they need to think of an example
- If you notice that a candidate is getting nervous, it’s okay to say, “take a breath, take a pause, it is just as important for you to ask me questions and it is for me to ask you”

If you ask a candidate to tell you a problem that they identified and then took the initiative to solve, and the candidate says, “the problem was that things were falling through the cracks” and then stops - obviously we’re not going to be able to walk away from that answer thinking that they nailed it or failed it. Interviewers are going to need to dig deeper. Think about using the “tell me about” phrasing as a way to drill down to get to the root of the answer. To follow up on that answer, you could say, “tell me, how did you identify that things were falling through the cracks? Tell me, why was that a problem? Tell me, what did you do to fix that problem? Tell me, what initiative did you take?”

Whatever it takes to drill down to actually get an answer that allows you to confidently determine that they either embody a particular value or they do not. Those follow up questions are not scripted and it’s where interviewers will need to be mindful of the legal training. For example, you should avoid saying, “tell me how your outside hobbies affected your ability to solve this problem of things slipping through the cracks.”

What if we are interviewing candidates who are early in their career and do not have specific work examples? We recommend that you leave it open ended, but you can advise them to use examples from internships or college to draw upon.

One of ​​Sourcegraph’s values is to be “customer driven.” Candidates early in their career who haven't had a job may not understand what that means. As a recruiter, I technically don't deal with our external customers, but I consider every single team member at Sourcegraph to be my internal customers. We can phrase that question to candidates early in their career as, “maybe your internal customer at the time who you were delivering something to was your professor? What problem did they pose to you and what did you do about it?” As we look to formulate these questions, we're going to make sure that they are applicable to a diverse background pool, not just people who are dealing with external customers or who have had robust work experience.

I also like to remind my candidates that this is not a marathon. They should take a pause and think about their answer. I've been a candidate, too, and sometimes you just want to answer everything and not take your time to think about it. If I notice that a candidate is getting nervous or starting to slip up on their words, it is perfectly fine to say, “I want you to take a breath and take a pause. This is just a conversation, and it is equally as important for you to ask me questions and get to know me. So please take a second and feel free to regroup.” Often candidates are able to decompress and calm down and they end up doing great.

[Here](https://app4.greenhouse.io/plans/4005818004/process/edit) is an example of Nick’s interview plan for the Director of Engineering role. This gives you a glimpse into what it looks like on the backend for a hiring manager to establish a set of structured interview questions so we are set up for success. In this example, every step of the process has focus attributes and interview questions. This is what is going to guide our interviewers every step of the way. This is a great example of what a thoughtful and well built out plan looks like. It will allow every candidate that goes through the process to have a standardized, streamlined, consistent, and fair process.

Please provide feedback as soon as possible, ideally no later than 24 hours after the interview, so that we can move quickly and ensure a positive candidate experience. You can use Brighthire to review the interview and copy / paste notes at a later time, but please try your best to get in the habit of submitting feedback directly after the interview since recall reduces by 44% after one hour. Feedback is best when you use the attributes to help score responses.

Most importantly, please do not talk to anybody else about their feedback if you were in a panel interview. If somebody went right before you went right after you, please don't ask for their feedback until you have officially filled yours out. That is a surefire way to introduce bias into your decision making. You should feel conviction in your process and your assessment of the candidate. If we notice that some candidate has gotten a couple yeses and a no, we will bring the team together to talk about it and determine why that happened. We can leverage BrightHire again here to see if there was a miscommunication or if their story was inconsistent. BrightHire will allow us to dig deeper if the panel did not agree on a decision.

Please leverage the definitions in this interview feedback [overall recommendation guide](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/talent/interview_process#overall-recommendation) when rating candidates in Greenhouse. It’s natural to want to make hiring decisions based on comparison points. As you talk to more people, you can start to understand where certain candidates fall in comparison. That being said, we should avoid the “shopping effect” - where we feel like we need to talk to five or 10 candidates in order to make a hiring decision. Sometimes it’s the first candidate we talk to that’s the best fit, and by the time we’ve talked to all of the other folks, we’ve lost that person.

Now, our goal is still to interview a number of candidates before making a decision. I had an interviewer who had been a strong yes on a candidate. Yesterday, she interviewed another candidate and said, “Wait, I like this new person better. While I'm going to keep my strong yes on the first candidate, I would prefer to hire this new candidate.” This is perfectly fine too. It didn’t change her assessment that the first candidate was a strong yes, it just warranted a conversation with the hiring manager. The interviewer said, “I actually think we have another contender who might be stronger and here's why. Let’s talk about it before making a hiring decision.” This is when the debriefs and collaboration come into play.

There are plenty of companies that pull interviewers into a room and stack rank candidates. We want to avoid this to the best of our abilities. Rather than comparing candidates together in a room, ask yourself a binary question, “can this candidate do the job, yes or no?” Then consider where this candidate would fall in terms of being an example to others. It’s difficult because our brains are wired to compare, which introduces bias because we start to trend towards likability and/or recency bias.

Ultimately, it's ideal if you can interview two or three people and you are a yes on all of them against the clear guidelines and questions that we've provided. It's ultimately up to the hiring manager to make the final call as to who they're going to be moving forward with. Our goal is to put in structure to prevent that bias and establish definitions so we're all speaking the same language.

Lastly, be mindful about what you leave in your interview form. There should be nothing illegal, like “diversity hire.” Candidates have the right to request access to this information. All written feedback should follow the same set of rules and guidelines that were addressed in our interview question do’s and don’ts. A good rule of thumb, again, is to think, “does what I'm about to write directly relate to their ability to do the job?”

We've all been interviewed before and every experience is different. Whether or not you get the job, you'll always remember how you were treated by the company. 83% of candidates say that an unimpressive interview can make them change their mind about a potential employer. Since job seekers are empowered to be selective when considering opportunities, the experience they have during the recruitment process is crucial.

It's important to ensure that any candidate who interviews with Sourcegraph has a top notch experience. Even if the candidate doesn't get the job, they will more than likely share their experience with others. They may leave a review on a job site like Glassdoor or perhaps refer their friends and family to Sourcegraph.

This means that you need to respect the candidate's time, clearly explain the position, build a connection, provide everything they need to make an informed decision, and ensure they feel excited and confident about the role and Sourcegraph.

Candidates are understandably nervous and the interview process can be really stressful. Your attitude should convey that everything you do is to help them succeed and not fail.

Creating a five star experience requires you to make sure your candidate's needs are met at every step of the hiring process. Conveying a consistent message about the value of your company and leading with kindness in every interaction is critical to Sourcegraph’s hiring brand.

I've worked for companies in the past where we hired 1% of applicants. That means that we are interviewing hundreds of people who don't get jobs. We want to make sure that every single one of those people are going to their friends, their family, their networks and saying, “despite the fact that I didn't get hired, Sourcegraph seems like an incredible company, I felt super respected throughout the process, and it was the best interview experience that I've ever had, bar none.”

Please make sure to start your interviews with an agenda and end with rapport building and selling. The middle is the time for screening and asking those structured questions. The agenda goes a long way with candidates so that they know what's coming and they can prepare. At the end, remind the candidates that interviewing is a two way street and we want them to feel like they have all their questions answered. This will require you to pace yourself, watch the clock, and make sure you leave enough time at the end. When the structured questions go to the very end and you catch yourself only allowing two minutes for questions, it’s unfair to the candidate. They feel like they're not getting the questions they need answered in order to make the best decision for themselves.

Even if you realize that candidate experience should be a priority, it can be hard to know what to do about it. Data can help Sourcegraph see trends and identify problem areas. Taking a data-driven approach to candidate satisfaction also helps us measure progress over time.

We use an anonymous candidate survey through Greenhouse to gather data and feedback on our candidate experience and recruiting process. [Click here](https://www.greenhouse.io/guidance/a-quick-guide-to-improving-candidate-experience-with-candidate-surveys) to see more information about the Greenhouse candidate survey.

Every candidate is going to get surveyed with these questions, which are automatically sent 24 hours after we have either hired or rejected them. We are able to pull reports to see where we're hitting the mark and where we're missing the mark, which, of course we're going to take immediate action to rectify and put processes in place to make it better.
