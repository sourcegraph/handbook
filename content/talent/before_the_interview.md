This page outlines all the steps both the Hiring Manager and Recruiting team need to take to kick off a new search.  All steps outlined below need to take place before any formal interviewing occurs.

## Intake Call Guidelines

Hiring managers are required to have an intake meeting with their respective Recruiter before beginning the candidate search. In an ideal world, the intake meeting should be scheduled after the Hiring Manager has completed the [intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYwWlI_4bKKSkhWq4FrLNE2MPEhRtiq91GtEC6RuFAt-mgfA/viewform) and the Recruiter has reviewed this information.

The intake meeting is intended for the Hiring Manager and the Recruiter to get on the same page about job requirements, the ideal candidate, and the proposed interview process.

**Step 1:** Please use the below checklist to ensure you cover the necessary topics during the intake meeting. You can also review the [intake form response](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dpf6aDw1ESJRYroJz6-ZtaACJxwjEu4my_xeYuB3a7E/edit#gid=2123710308) on our Open Job Report.

- Time zone/location restrictions
- Ideal start date
- Ideal candidate profile
- 3 LinkedIn examples
- Alternative titles
- Required software/tools

- Screening questions
- Selling points
- Any additional information
- Job description

**Step 2:** Please review the [interview plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pMG_K3pf_pP_AIvy8jjOKc-h6htDJ5QkvEMD3prAQ5Y/edit#gid=1808593536) and ensure all interview sections are completed and consistent with our [Types of Interviews](./types_of_interviews.md).

In addition to reviewing these topics during the intake meeting, the Recruiter and the Hiring Manager will select the [Values Interview](./hiring/evaluating_values.md) Panel. Using [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NUDEjzud_GxocjKkd__m0hTf21tN3OIgOwtk_OjhV20/edit?ts=60e4c3bd#gid=0), the Recruiter and the Hiring Manager select two people who are highlighted in green (indicating that they have been here for 3 months or longer). When choosing two people to be on the Values Interview, please keep in mind the following:

- must have been here for 3+ months
- must be two people from different departments
- please keep diversity in mind when selecting teams

Once the Recruiter and the Hiring Manager have identified the interviewers, the Recruiter will ensure they are trained & ready to go!

## **Slack Kick-Off Process**

Once the Recruiter has conducted an intake call and the interview plan is complete, the Recruiter officially kicks off the role in Slack.

1. Create a new channel slack channel named: “team-hiring_position_recruiter-name”
   1. Example: “ops-hiring_handbook-product-manager_recruiter-kelsey”
2. Invite the entire interview panel plus VP Talent & Recruiting Coordinator to the channel
3. Tag VP Talent to make the channel private
4. Once private, send kick off note using the below template:

Hi team! We are excited to kick off our [hyperlink job description] opening and I appreciate all of you participating in the interview process. I thought it would be helpful to create a Slack channel to stay aligned as we begin interviewing candidates!
