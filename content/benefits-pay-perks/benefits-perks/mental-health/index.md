# Mental health support at Sourcegraph

## What is mental health?

The World Health Organization [defines mental health](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response) as:

> “A state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own
> abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work
> productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his
> or her community.”

## Long-term goals

1. Normalize the discussion and reduce stigma about mental health across the Sourcegraph
   team.
2. Increase access to and awareness of existing mental health resources for the Sourcegraph team.
3. Understand how our asynchronous culture can contribute to improved mental health for team members, specifically by decreasing the total number of synchronous meetings for team members.
4. Increase documentation about mental health management resources in our handbook by collaborating and sharing strategies and tools that work.
