# Teammate Gatherings and Celebrations

Here at Sourcegraph, we encourage frequent team virtual and in-person gatherings outside of work. We also like to celebrate our teammates' birthdays and work anniversaries! Use this guide for team gatherings and to celebrate your teammates' birthdays, anniversaries, and source great gift ideas.

**The People team is currently revamping our swag and gifting policies and will announce updates soon.**

## Who is responsible

### Teammate Gatherings:

- Teammates are responsible for submitting their own receipts for reimbursement when individually utilizing the [Teammate Gatherings](#teammate-gatherings) budget.
- Managers are responsible for submitting their team's receipt for reimbursement if they're booking for the whole team.

### Celebrations: Birthdays and work anniversaries

**Managers own celebrating their teammates' birthdays and work anniversaries.**

## Teammate Gatherings

### Virtual Gatherings

In addition to our travel budget for in-person meetups, we encourage teams to gather for fun activities in a virtual setting. Each team has $150 per person per quarter to spend on a team gathering of their choice. This budget can be used for a wide array of activities including meals, games, prizes, etc. For single-events with expenditures above $1,500 please request approval from the finance team (finance@sourcegraph.com). This can be expensed under the "Team Travel" categories.

### In-Person Gatherings

As an all-remote company, we want everyone to feel included and connected, regardless of where they’re located. As such, each teammate has $150 per person per quarter to spend on a gathering of their choice (in addition to travel budgets). This budget can be used for a wide array of activities including meals, transportation, etc. We will reimburse only your own portion of the bill if you include a non-teammate, so make sure to separate your bills or ask for separate receipts. This can be expensed under the "Team Travel" categories.

## Work Anniversaries

We love celebrating work anniversaries! Each manager is responsible for celebrating their teammates' yearly milestones here at Sourcegraph. Managers can easily access all teammate anniversaries by checking their Bamboo HR homepage.

To celebrate anniversaries, managers can send gifts to their direct reports according to the [gift amount policy](#gift-amount-policy-for-anniversaries) detailed below.

### Best practices for celebrating a teammate's work anniversary

- The manager posts a written or video message in the `#thanks` channel and then lets the teammate know they can expense $XX to celebrate.
- Please follow the [anniversary gift amount policy](#gift-amount-policy-for-anniversaries)
- Post suggestions:
  - Announce the occasion: "A huge #thanks and congrats to [name] on their [#] year anniversary at Sourcegraph!"
  - Highlight the teammates' key contributions and impact they've made

### Gift amount policy for anniversaries

Anniversary gifts should not exceed the following amounts per teammate and per year:

- Year 1: $50 USD
- Year 2: $75 USD
- Year 3: $100 USD
- Year 4: $200 USD
- Year 5+: $250 USD

## Birthdays

Sourcegraph encourages teammates to take a day of vacation on their special day in alignment with our [**Paid Time Off Policy**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nqkTF_e32wx_WMw5Y1a2C8iyh-iRtIcC9Mc54YwPSko/edit). If your celebration happens to fall over a weekend please be sure to take an alternate day such as the Friday prior or the Monday after.

### Best practices for celebrating a teammate's birthday:

- Be considerate of all teammates and acknowledge that not everybody likes to be in the spotlight on their birthdays. Managers should check their employee’s BambooHR profile for their birthday and ask them personally if they’d like to celebrate it at work beforehand. With their permission, people managers will post about the occasion in slack and offer a gift.
- The manager posts about the occasion in the `#thanks` channel and then lets the teammate know they can expense $XX to celebrate.
  - TIP: You can pre-schedule your Slack messages to send on the correct dates!
- Please follow the [birthday gift amount policy](#gift-amount-policy-for-birthdays).
- Post suggestions:
  - Announce the occasion: "A huge #thanks and congrats to [name] on their [#] year anniversary at Sourcegraph!"
  - Highlight the teammates' key contributions and impact they've made

## Other personal milestones

Other personal milestones such as promotion, marriage, baby announcement, and so forth, can be celebrated at the discretion of teammates. Sourcegraph does not have a budget for celebrating these milestones as they are not experienced by every person on a regular cadence. However, teammates are still welcome to celebrate these milestones if they choose!

## Branded swag

**Custom internal requests:**

- There are times that teammates will want to order _custom Sourcegraph swag_ for other occasions, such as a team trip or team accomplishment. Read about [Ordering additional swag](../../departments/people-talent/swag.md#ordering-additional-swag). If you have any questions, please reach out to the People Team in [#ask-people-team](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/CQAGQKC4A) in Slack or people-ops@sourcegraph.com.

**External requests:**

- See how to [send swag](../../departments/marketing/swag.md) to people outside of Sourcegraph.

## Sending gifts via mail

If you require a teammate's address to send a gift, please ask the teammate directly if they are comfortable sharing their address for gift purposes. (While People Ops and managers do have access to address information, it is considered confidential and just as with other information of sensitive nature, we are unable to share it as with others).

_Happy celebrating!_
