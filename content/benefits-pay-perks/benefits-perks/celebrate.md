# Teammate Celebrations & Gatherings

Here at Sourcegraph, we encourage frequent team virtual and in-person gatherings outside of work. We also like to celebrate, and we like to celebrate _you_! Use this guide for team gatherings and to celebrate your teammates' milestones. Recommended milestones to celebrate include:

- anniversaries
- birthdays
- promotions
- new babies

## Anniversaries

We like to take the time to celebrate big milestones for teammates who have hit their yearly anniversaries (_and beyond_)! It is Sourcegraph custom for the manager of a teammate who has hit a yearly milestone to record a video message highlighting their accomplishments. This message is then posted in #thanks. Managers can easily access all teammate anniversaries by checking their Bamboo HR homepage.

To celebrate anniversaries, managers can send gifts to their direct reports according to the [gift amount policy](#gift-amount-policy-for-anniversaries) detailed below.

### Gift amount policy for anniversaries

Anniversary gifts should not exceed the following amounts per teammate and per year:

- Year 1: $50 USD
- Year 2: $75 USD
- Year 3: $100 USD
- Year 4: $200 USD
- Year 5+: $250 USD

## Birthdays

Sourcegraph encourages teammates to take a day of vacation on their special day in alignment with our [**Paid Time Off Policy**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nqkTF_e32wx_WMw5Y1a2C8iyh-iRtIcC9Mc54YwPSko/edit). If your celebration happens to fall over a weekend please be sure to take an alternate day such as the Friday prior or the Monday after.

We’d also like to be considerate of all teammates and acknowledge that not everybody likes to be in the spotlight on their birthdays. Managers should check their employee’s BambooHR profile for their birthday and ask them personally if they’d like to celebrate it at work beforehand. With their permission, people managers will consult their team on an appropriate gift / gift card for the employee and can expense this using [Airbase](../../departments/finance/process/payables.md).

To add the BambooHR "Birthdays" calendar to your Google Calendar, please use this link (https://sourcegraph.bamboohr.com/feeds/feed.php?id=535bc86f7d5ecda6e76e4e3a05291665) and perform the following steps:

- Go to **Google Calendar**
- Click **Settings**
- Click **Add calendar**
- Click **From URL**
- Paste link in **URL of calendar** box
- Click **Add calendar**.

### Gift amount policy for birthdays

Birthday gifts should not exceed **$50 USD** _per teammate_. It is also advisable to spend the same amount for each person on your team when getting a gift for them to create fairness within the group.

COMING SOON

## Gift ideas

**The People team is currently revamping our swag and gifting policies and will announce updates soon.** Until then, managers will own celebrating their teammates' milestone events (birthdays, anniversaries, promotions, and life events).

For **anniversaries**, we suggest posting about the occasion in the `#thanks` channel and then letting the teammate know they can expense $XX to celebrate.

Sample post:

- "A huge #thanks and congrats to [name] on their [#] year anniversary at Sourcegraph! `Insert highlights re: their key contributions and impact`"

For **birthdays**, we suggest posting in a team channel or sending a #slack directly to the teammate.

Sample post:

- Wishing the amazing @teammate the BEST birthday today. Teammate Name - I am so appreciative of everything you do and couldn't imagine this team without you :heart: :tada: :birthday: treat yourself (and expense) with $50 from us!

You are welcome to 1. send a gift directly, or 2. tell the Teammate that they can treat themselves and submit for reimbusment directly. If you chose the 2nd option, following your post in #Slack, please ping the Teammate directly and let them know they can purchase a gift and submit it for reimbursement. Please be sure to follow the [anniversary gift amount policy](#gift-amount-policy-for-anniversaries) and [birthday gift amount policy](#gift-amount-policy-for-birthdays).

## Other personal milestones

Other personal milestones such as promotion, marriage, baby announcement, and so forth, can be celebrated at the discretion of teammates. Sourcegraph does not have a budget for celebrating these milestones as they are not experienced by every person on a regular cadence. However, teammates are still welcome to celebrate these milestones if they choose!

## Virtual Gatherings

In addition to our travel budget for in-person meetups, we encourage teams to gather for fun activities in a virtual setting.

Each team has **$150 per person per quarter** to spend on a team gathering of their choice. This budget can be used for a wide array of activities including meals, games, prizes, etc. For single-events with expenditures above $1,500 please request approval from the finance team (finance@sourcegraph.com). This can be expensed under the "Team Travel" categories.

## Sending gifts via mail

If you require a teammate's address to send a gift, please ask the teammate directly if they are comfortable sharing their address for gift purposes. (While People Ops and managers do have access to address information, it is considered confidential and just as with other information of sensitive nature, we are unable to share it as with others).

_Happy celebrating!_
