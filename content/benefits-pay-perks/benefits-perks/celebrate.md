# Internal Teammate Gifting

At Sourcegraph, we love celebrating and recognizing the events happening in our teammates' lives! Below are the occasions we send gifts to our teammates and what those processes look like.

## When we send gifts to teammates

The People team is responsible for sending gifts for:
- New hires
- Promotions
- New babies
- Company Offsites 

Managers are responsible for sending gifts for:
- Birthdays
- Work Anniversaries
- Team Accomplishments 

Managers will receive an email reminder from BambooHR when one of their direct reports has an upcoming birthday/work anniversary and it is the manager's responsibility to send a gift that is in line with the birthday budget and anniversary budgets listed below. 

Managers are welcome to celebrate their teams’ other life events at each teammate’s discretion.Sourcegraph does not have a budget for celebrating these milestones as they are not experienced by every person on a regular cadence. However, teammates are still welcome to celebrate these milestones if they choose!

## How we send gifts to teammates
### Birthdays

Each manager is responsible for celebrating their teammates' birthdays and sending a gift according to the [gift amount policy](#gift-amount-policy-for-anniversaries) detailed below. Best practice is to leverage [Loop & Tie]. 

Be considerate of all teammates and acknowledge that not everybody likes to be in the spotlight on their birthdays. Managers should check their employee’s BambooHR profile for their birthday and ask them personally if they’d like to celebrate it at work beforehand. With their permission, people managers will post about the occasion in a Team Slack (or directly via dm) and offer a gift.

- The manager posts about the occasion in the team channel or 1:1
- Team post suggestions:
  - Announce the occasion: "A huge #thanks and happy birthday to [name] on their [#] year anniversary at Sourcegraph! Please treat yourself to a $50 gift and celebrate yourself!"
  - Highlight the teammates' key contributions and impact they've made
  - TIP: You can pre-schedule your Slack messages to send on the correct dates
- The manager [sends a gift](#how-to-send-a-gift) within the [birthday gift amount policy](#gift-amount-policy-for-birthdays). Alternatively, you can let your teammate know that they can treat themselves and submit a reimbursement for up to $50 USD.

Sourcegraph encourages teammates to take a day of vacation on their special day in alignment with our [**Paid Time Off Policy**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nqkTF_e32wx_WMw5Y1a2C8iyh-iRtIcC9Mc54YwPSko/edit). If a Teammate's celebration happens to fall over a weekend, please be sure to take an alternate day such as the Friday prior or the Monday after.

To view and add the BambooHR "Birthdays" calendar to your Google Calendar, please use [this link](https://sourcegraph.bamboohr.com/feeds/feed.php?id=535bc86f7d5ecda6e76e4e3a05291665) and perform the following steps:

- Click **Add calendar**
- Click **From URL**
- Paste link in **URL of calendar** box
- Click **Add calendar**.

#### Birthday gift budget

Birthday gifts should not exceed **$50 USD** _per teammate_ and per year. It is also advisable to spend the same amount for each person on your team when getting a gift for them to create fairness within the group.

### Work anniversaries:

Each manager is responsible for celebrating their teammates' yearly milestones and sending a gift according to the [gift amount policy](#gift-amount-policy-for-anniversaries) detailed below. Best practice is to leverage [Loop & Tie]. Managers can easily access all teammate anniversaries by checking their Bamboo HR homepage.

**Best practices for celebrating a work anniversary**

- The manager posts a written or video message in the #thanks channel
- Post suggestions:
  - Announce the occasion: "A huge #thanks and congrats to [name] on their [#] year anniversary at Sourcegraph!"
  - Highlight the teammates' key contributions and impact they've made
  - TIP: You can pre-schedule your Slack messages to send on the correct dates!
- The manager [sends a gift](#how-to-send-a-gift) within the [anniversary gift amount policy](#gift-amount-policy-for-anniversaries). Alternatively, you can let your teammate know that they can treat themselves and submit a reimbursement for up to $XX USD.

#### Anniversary gift budget

Anniversary gifts should not exceed the following amounts per teammate and per year:

- Year 1: $50 USD
- Year 2: $75 USD
- Year 3: $100 USD
- Year 4: $200 USD
- Year 5+: $250 USD

### Promotions

At Sourcegraph, promotions are a big deal - and communicating promotions is one of the single biggest opportunities to widely celebrate teammate contributions! The People Team is currently working to develop a custom promotion gift, but in the meantime, we encourage Managers to share the news broadly to recognize their teammates’ accomplishments!

Managers are responsible for announcing their teammates’ promotions. The following are recommended next steps, as well as a sample promotion announcement.

- [Send a gift!](#how-to-send-a-gift) - we recommend $150
- Send a Slack in `#teammate-announce` and cross-post in `#thanks`. At minimum, these posts should cover:
  - recognizing the hard work of the individual being promoted
  - providing insight into the individual’s new responsibilities
  - how the teammate's performance and actions embody [our values](../../company-info-and-process/values/index.md)
  - serving as aspirational to others who strive to be promoted in the future
- Sample Slack message:
  - Hi Team! I am thrilled to announce that (TEAMMATE NAME) has been promoted to (NEW TITLE)! For the past (PERIOD OF TIME), (TEAMMATE NAME) has been responsible for (PREVIOUS ROLE/RESPONSIBILITIES/ACCOMPLISHMENTS) that have resulted in (BUSINESS IMPACT/OUTCOME). Going forward, (TEAMMATE NAME) will bring (their/his/her) knowledge, skills and experience into their new role as (NEWLY PROMOTED TITLE) doing (NEWLY PROMOTED RESPONSIBILITIES). Please join me in congratulating (TEAMMATE NAME) on (their/his/her) well-deserved promotion and wish (them/him/her) best of luck in (their/him/her) new role!

## What gifts to send

### Loop & Tie
Our recommended gifting platform is [Loop & Tie](https://sourcegraph.loopandtie.com/). Loop & Tie offers curated collections of gifts organized by price and shipping location (US and International). Then our teammates get to select the gift they truly want from whichever collection they were gifted. 

Managers must have a Loop & Tie account to send a gift. To create a Loop & Tie account, please reach out to the People team in the #swag slack channel and a current Loop & Tie admin (Kemper or Fabiana) will invite you to create an account.

Once you have an account, here is [how to send a Loop & Tie gift](https://guides.loopandtie.com/knowledge/how-to-send-a-gift-on-loop-tie).

**Managers are expected to add their own credits to their Loop & Tie account using a credit card that is associated with their team's budget.**
When you're placing an order, you will see under 'Your Payment Method,' an option to select 'Add Payment Method.' This will prompt you to enter your credit card information like any other online checkout.

Loop & Tie FAQS:

- **Q: Will the recipient see the gift price?** A: Your Loop & Tie recipient never sees the gift budget you selected. They just see the items available to them in the collection you selected!
- **Q: Can I change or add products to the collections?** A: We are not able to facilitate changes/additions at this time.

### Sending gifts via mail

If you require a teammate's address to send a gift, please ask the teammate directly if they are comfortable sharing their address for gift purposes. (While People Ops and managers do have access to address information, it is considered confidential and just as with other information of sensitive nature, we are unable to share it as with others).

## Branded swag

### Custom internal requests:

There are times that teammates will want to order _custom Sourcegraph swag_ for other occasions, such as a team trip or team accomplishment. Below are things to consider and steps to take to begin the ordering process. If you have any questions, please reach out in #swag in Slack.

**Budget** 
The budget for additional swag (any swag besides the new hire kit) will be the responsibility of the team requesting the swag order. For example, if the Talent team is requesting custom hats for a team trip, this order will be paid for using the Talent team’s budget.

Individual teams will not be responsible for finding budget for company-wide swag shipments such as product release swag (for example, the 2022 Code Insights T-shirts).

**Who to reach out to**
When you’re ready to begin an order, please fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCBlGZA4HOEi3oh-uEQt2NaK9wh8qtWlVzfIAavkTJQQxz0w/viewform) to provide the following information: 
- What is the occasion you’re ordering swag for? 
- What type of swag do you want to order (ex: hats, backpacks, etc.)
- When do you need the swag in-hand? (We recommend starting the ordering process at least 6-8 prior to the delivery date)
- What quantity will you need?
- What countries will you need the swag shipped to? 
- Have you confirmed your team has the budget for this order?

Once you’ve completed the google form, someone from the People team will connect you via email with our custom swag vendor, Telescope, who will facilitate the ordering process.

Brand Guidelines
When designing custom swag, please follow our [brand guidelines](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/marketing/brand/brand_guidelines/) and run any mock-ups past the [brand team](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/marketing/brand/#the-team) if you have any questions.
