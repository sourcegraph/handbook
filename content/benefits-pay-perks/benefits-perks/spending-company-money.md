# Spending company money

We want to make sure you have what you need to be productive and happy in your role at Sourcegraph, so we've come up with a few guidelines to help you when you have work-related expenses. Below you'll find a list of some typical purchases that you would be reimbursed for, as well as a few things to keep in mind when expensing purchases:

- You are free to purchase these items and expense them without asking permission as long as it's in the interest of the company. When in doubt, please contact @sourcegraph/people-ops for clarification before the purchase.
- You likely won't need every single item on this list—please use your best judgment and buy when you need them. Remember, Sourcegraph doesn't have unlimited funds—spend this money as if it was your own.
  - For example, if you intend to work out of a coworking space most of the time, you may not need a fully equipped home office as well.
- If you spend more than $1,000 on any given physical item, it will be considered property of the company.
- Please file an expense report within 60 days of an eligible purchase. See [submitting expenses](../pay-expenses/expenses/index.md) for additional help.

Directions for how to determine how much spend you have left in each travel category, professional development, or desk setup can be found [here ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXAKh2DHitaFCFmNCEqpYBPbknhJ8IC0r-deDSFlht4/edit?usp=sharing) for additional help.

## Desk set-up

### Full-time teammates

We expect new teammates to spend up to **$2,000** for desk setup, which includes all the items in the "Desk items" section.

As a reminder, you don't need permission for every purchase, and we trust you to make decisions that are in the best interests of Sourcegraph. If you expect to exceed the listed amount on any purchase, however, please notify @sourcegraph/people-ops and finance@sourcegraph.com.

If you don't spend all of your budget when you first join, it's ok to spend it later providing you remain inside the total budget.

#### Team-specific totals

- We expect new [Design team](../../departments/engineering/design/index.md) members to spend **$2,650** to allow for purchasing higher-resolution monitors or other design equipment.
- Since they are customer-facing and need to deliver high-quality demos and support, [Customer Engineering](../../departments/technical-success/ce/index.md) team members can exceed these limits (within reason) to allow for purchasing beefier-spec computers, additional monitors, mics, lighting, etc.

### Interns

The estimated spend for interns is **$925\***.

### Desk items

- Monitor
- Headphones
- Keyboard
- Mouse or trackpad
- USB-C Adapter
- HDMI/monitor cable
- Laptop stand
- Desk
- Ergonomic chair
- Camera (for people who present externally to clients and prospects)

Note: Our policy is that all teammates have a sourcegraph-managed laptop to perform all work pertaining to their role at Sourcegraph and we only support Mac computers at this time, so teammates are not able to expense a PC. See below for more information on computers and ordering your laptop.

## Computers

All Sourcegraph teammates are required to have, and to work from, a company machine that is set up accoring to our [device requirements](../../departments/tech-ops/tools/computer-setup.md). Computers are considered property of the company.

Please see below how to get your computer and which specs to get depending on your role.

### Ordering your laptop:

Please place an order for your Sourcegraph computer immediately after signing your contract. You are responsible for ordering your laptop through one of the following ways:

**US/Canada/UK-based teammates**

Place an order via [this form](https://forms.gle/1PVxXwLJ9WFJvref9) and our Tech Ops team will purchase them through CDW US/CA or our partner in the UK.

**Teammates based in other countries** are responsible for purchasing and expensing their Sourcegraph computer. All computers should be purchased new and either through your local Apple store or a [preferred device enrollment resellers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213322) (Tech Ops can provide you with our Apple ID). All MacBooks and Apple Care insurance are fully reimbursable outside of the [desk setup total estimate above](#desk-set-up). You can find information on how to expense computers [here](../pay-expenses/expenses/index.md).

Typically, these devices are an older models than what we order new. Interns should adhear to our [computer requirements](../../departments/tech-ops/tools/computer-setup.md) for setting up their Sourcegraph device.

## Recurring expenses

**Software/SaaS/cloud:** please check with the appropriate team and manager to ask if we already have a subscription or licenses to the software. If not, please get @sourcegraph/people-ops's approval for software or a subscription that would cost more than $500 per year.

**[Internet, phone, and wellness](../pay-expenses/expenses/index.md#internet-phone-and-wellness-benefits):** The following items are automatically added to your pay, and they don't need to be expensed.

- **Internet/WiFi plan:** $50/month
- **Cell phone plan:** $75/month
- **Wellness:** $100/month

**Co-working/office space:** $300–500/month for renting your space, including parking up to $20 per day while you are working from your designated co-working space.

This budget also includes public transportation and rideshare to and from co-working spaces up to $20 per day. Gas reimbursement is not included. When submitting for transportation reimbursement for coworking space a **receipt must be included regardless of amount**.

You will not need permission for choosing which co-working space you’d like to sign up for. We trust that you will pick a co-working space which both benefits you and is within budgetary reason. Our only recommendation is that you pick a co-working space on a _day-to-day drop in basis_ or a _month-to-month basis_ for ease of monthly reimbursement.

The Company will not cover the cost of a co-working space deposit or sign for coworking space contracts. Additionally, if you would like to setup a group co-working space with pooled teammate funds, please send a message to People Ops and Finance stating Name(s) and Team Role(s), Location of space, and estimated monthly cost. For group rentals, we recommend one person submit a monthly invoice and tag all attendees.

> Note: This budget is meant to be an average cost of co-working spaces,
> and serves as a recommendation. It should be dependent on the average
> cost of co-working spaces in your particular geo-location. If your
> co-working space is more than $500 USD, please get approval from People Ops
> and Finance via email.

**Education and professional development (conferences, courses):** $1000 USD/year (if your professional development conference, event, or purchase exceeds this amount, simply notify People Ops & Finance via email with the anticipated cost to obtain approval). If any of the above meet the guidelines for usage and fall within your $1,000 allowance, you do not need approval from Finance + People Ops. If you have your eye on something that exceeds the allowance, but is important to your role and/or team, please first raise the request with your manager and your manager can reach out to Finance for approval prior to booking.

**Moving (moving, packing, shipping, etc.):** $1000/year

## Other expenses:

**Laptop repairs:** if your laptop requires repairs, we cover up to $500 a year on repairs. If necessary repairs exceed the yearly budget please reach out to @sourcegraph/people-ops's for approval.

**Travel expenses:** please see our page on [travel budgets](travel/index.md).

**Virtual and in-person (local) teammate gatherings:** Each teammate has a budget of $150/quarter for virtual team gatherings and $150/quarter for local teammate gatherings. [Please see the travel budgets page for more details.](travel/index.md#in-person-gatherings-that-dont-require-travel)
