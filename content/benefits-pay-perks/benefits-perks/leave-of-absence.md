### Reason for the policy

At Sourcegraph, we believe that our employees' well-being is a top priority. That's why we offer medical leave policies to all full-time teammates, providing them with time off to care for themselves or a family member as they recover from a serious health condition. Our goal is to create a teammate-friendly culture that fosters professional growth and development while prioritizing the health of our employees and their families.

We understand that unexpected medical situations can be stressful and challenging to navigate. That's why we provide resources for teammates and their immediate family members who are dealing with a planned or unforeseen medical event.

If you're expecting the birth or adoption of a child, please refer to our [Sourcegraph’s Paid Parental Leave Policy](parental-leave.md). We recognize the unique needs of new parents and strive to provide support during this important time.

### LOA TL;DR

- **Eligibility (personal):** any teammate requiring **more than 1-week of leave** to tend to a personal physical or mental condition is eligible for paid leave at Sourcegraph. To be eligible, a medical professional must advise a leave of absence from work and a note from a medical care provider must be submitted to the People Team.
- **Eligibility (family member):** any teammate who requires more than one week of leave to care for an ill immediate family member is eligible for paid leave at Sourcegraph. To be eligible, the teammate must be the primary caregiver during the medical condition. Additionally, a medical professional must advise a leave of absence from work, and a note from a medical care provider must be submitted to the People Team.
  - Immediate family includes: child, spouse, parent. If your need to care for someone is outside of this group, please reach out to [people-ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com).
- **Leave duration:**
  - Paid leave: we provide eligible teammates with up to 4 weeks of **paid leave.**
  - Unpaid leave: following 4 weeks of paid leave, teammates are eligible for eight weeks of **unpaid leave**.
  - In total, a teammate can take up to 12 weeks of Medical leave per year (12 months from initial leave).
  - Medical leave must be taken consecutively per medical event. If intermittent leaves are medically necessary, Sourcegraph will work with you per our ADA process.
  - Anything over 12 weeks is not eligible under the medical leave policy. However, Sourcegraph may grant additional unpaid time off to reasonably accommodate teammates where medically necessary.
  - If non-commissioned teammate, [click here](leave-of-absence.md#Your-pay-while-on-LOA) for more information
  - If commissioned teammate, [click here](leave-of-absence.md#Resources-for-Quota-Carrying-Teammates-Sales-CE) for more information
- **Local laws:** This policy-including eligibility criteria, leave duration, and amount of paid leave–is subject to applicable local laws, which may provide different benefits. In those cases, the teammate will receive the greater entitlement. Where local laws entitle a teammate to a portion of leave paid for by the local government, Sourcegraph will work with the teammate to adjust Sourcegraph’s coverage, so that the total amount received by the teammate is consistent with but not duplicative of the entitlements under Sourcegraph’s policy and applicable local laws. See [FAQ](leave-of-absence.md#FAQ) for Non-US/statutory variances below.
- **How to request LOA:** to request a LOA, please alert your Manager and People Partner as soon as possible. You can read more about our step by step request process [here](leave-of-absence.md#How-to-request-LOA).

### Who is eligible for a LOA?

Eligibility starts on day 1 of employment. Teammates are eligible if they meet all the requirements below:

- Work full-time
- Have either:
  - A physical or mental health condition being treated by a medical professional while working for Sourcegraph and must be away for more than 1 week
  - An immediate family member who needs care causing the teammate to be away from work for more than 1 week
- Are in good standing (as determined by the Company in our sole discretion)
- Have a note from their medical provider or the family member's medical provider outlining the need and length of leave required. The note must include the following information:
  - Teammate or family member's full name
  - Whether the leave is for the teammate or an immediate family member
  - Whether the teammate needs a return-to-work release from the doctor
  - The dates of requested leave.

### Your pay while on LOA

- **Paid leave:** Eligible teammates are paid 100% of their base salary for up to 4 weeks of continuous absence for approved leaves of absence. If you live in a location that has statutory benefits, Sourcegraph will cover the difference between any country or state-sponsored benefits and your full salary. You must sign up for any country or state-sponsored leave benefits if available.
- **Unpaid leave:** If your LOA exceeds 4 weeks, you may take up to an additional 8 weeks of unpaid leave, or in alignment with statutory medical benefits and leave policies (dependent on location). This policy allows for a maximum of 12 weeks of medical leave, unless otherwise entitled under applicable statutory rights.
- **Commissioned teammates:** if you are on a commission plan, additional guidance is provided in the Commission Payout and Quota Relief section [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D2mLSYzXIJ5SKjCYn_Jukxmdzskc9vi2Z_nL6lnAgOs/edit#bookmark=id.n4dwkzvkn266].

Our Leave Management System, Tilt, will have a dashboard that outlines your base pay through the entirety of your leave.

- Please send an email to your Manager and/or People Partner to inform them you are requesting a LOA.

Once you have completed this step you can move to formally kick off the leave process by proceeding to step 2.

### **Step 2: Formally kick-off leave process**

**US Teammates:** To formally request leave, please initiate your leave on the Tilt platform.

1. You can access Tilt though [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/login) by selecting the Tilt tile on your homepage.
2. Once in Tilt, select the “new leave” button in the upper right corner.
3. A questionnaire will open. This will provide your Leave Case Manager all necessary information to support you through your leave. Information you will need to complete the questionnaire include:

- When will your leave start?
- Are you taking leave consecutively or intermittently?
- What location (city, state/providence) will you be based during your leave?
- Is your address accurate in BambooHR and Rippling?
- If you are an exempt (salary) or non-exempt (hourly) teammate?
- The number of hours you work per week? No need to adjust or change the pre-populated 40-hours per week.
- Select whether you would like email or text alerts from Tilt.

If you’re unsure how to answer any of these questions, feel free to reach out to the [people-ops](mailto:People-ops@sourcegraph.com) team.

Once you’ve completed the questionnaire, your Leave Case Manager will reach out in 1-2 business days to walk you through your leave plan. This will include any required paperwork for the city, state, federal laws, or company policies.

**Non-US Teammates:** To formally request leave, please fill out [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfHLAFwpdytqLqfurHHyNNyU58AI2Qt0zGkiSmlWoT7JgHqbQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to answer the below questions.

1. What type of leave are you requesting?
2. When will your leave start?
3. Are you taking leave consecutively or intermittently?
4. How many weeks of leave are you requesting?
5. What location (city, providence, & country) will you be based during your leave?
6. Is your address accurate in BambooHR and Rippling?
7. Do you have the required doctor's note to request medical leave?
8. Confirming question around account access while on leave
9. Open question forum

Once you’ve completed the Google Form, someone on the People Team will follow up with next steps:

- **All Contractor Teammates:** The People Team will be your main point of contact during your leave and will help you manage all your leave related inquiries.
- **PEO Teammates: **The People Team will work with your PEO to gather information on the leave process and requirements for your specific country and will work with you to prepare for your upcoming leave.

**Step 3: Pre-leave Tasks**

- **US Teammates:** Once you’ve communicated and your leave dates with Tilt, please keep a close eye on your email for all Tilt notifications and assigned tasks. They will provide guidance on how to prepare for leave, important information while you’re out on leave, and returning from leave.
- **Non-US Teammates:** Once you’ve communicated and confirmed your leave dates with the People Team, please log the exact leave and return-to-work dates using [Deel-PTO ](time-off/index.md#recording-pto)in Slack (select the Medical Leave category). Be sure to 'Assign your role' to your Manager.

**Step 4: Create & communicate your out of office plan with your team**

- **All Teammates:** We understand that emergencies happen, but please do your best to create an out of office plan before your LOA. See [example template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XfFl_JbyheCLIobG5gWhKvLibmPxZ5odt0_qgfya_3I/edit?usp=sharing) for reference.

### **Step 5: Take your leave**

- **All Teammates: **While you are out on leave your focus should be on taking care of yourself or a family member. Do not work (check work related platforms, complete projects, etc.). Your team will use your coverage plan to ensure work continues while you are out. For leaves longer than 2-weeks in length, your Okta account will be unavailable. You will regain access to Okta once you return from leave.
  - If you feel or receive pressure to complete work related tasks, please reach out to [People-Ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:People-Ops@sourcegraph.com).
- **US Teammates:** Tilt will be checking in during your time away to confirm state benefits are filed, approved, and confirm your return to work.
- **Non-US Teammates:** The People Team may be in touch with you from time to time to check in through your personal email address and ensure your return to work plan is on track. Please do your best to respond to the People Team.

### **Step 6: Prepare to return to work**

- **US Teammates:** Continue to monitor your Tilt notifications/emails and prepare for work. Tilt will reach out to confirm your return 1 week prior to your return.
  - IMPORTANT: If your return-to-work date needs to be changed, notify Tilt as soon as possible. You will also need to adjust your dates in Deel-PTO in Slack. Any extensions will need to be approved by the People Team and confirmed by your manager.
- **Non-US Teammates:** The People Team will email you to confirm your return to work 1 week prior to your return. Please respond to [People-Ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:People-Ops@sourcegraph.com) with your confirmed return date.
  - IMPORTANT: If your return-to-work date needs to be changed, please notify the People Team via email ([People-Ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:People-Ops@sourcegraph.com)) as soon as possible. You will also need to adjust your dates in Deel-PTO in Slack. Any extensions will need to be approved by the People Team and confirmed by your manager.

### **Step 7: Returning from medical leave**

Preparing for your first day back:

- Update availability and systems
  - Your Slack status may still be set as OOO – don’t forget to update this to signal to folks that you’re back
  - If you set up an auto-response or email forwarding for your email, make sure to update your email settings
  - Revisit your calendar availability and make adjustments, if needed
- Check in with your manager
  - Your manager will set up a 1:1 for your first day back to check in, provide updates, and discuss priorities.
  - Review the [Out of Office Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XfFl_JbyheCLIobG5gWhKvLibmPxZ5odt0_qgfya_3I/edit) that you and your manager put together prior to your leave as well as your 1-1 doc to catch up on in-progress projects and priorities.

### Additional resources

- Our Leave Management System, Tilt, has a dedicated leave case manager for each leave. They can support you through your leave and present all relevant resources. If you need additional support or help, please reach out to [people-ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com)

### FAQ

#### **FAQ for all Teammates (regardless of location)**

**Q: We have an [unlimited Paid Time Off (PTO) Policy](time-off/index.md). What is the difference and when should I take a LOA instead of Sick Time/PTO?**

- A: The main differentiators of using Sick Time/PTO vs. a LOA for a medical concern/condition are 1) the length of time away from work and 2) a doctor’s note requirement

  - PTO (sick time) should be used for medical concerns (for yourself or a dependent) requiring you to be away from work for 1 week or less in length (unless statutory guidance differs). A doctor’s note is not required.
  - LOA should be used for medical concerns that causes you to be out of office for more than 1 week consecutively. A doctor’s note is required.

**Q: Why is a doctor’s note required?**

- A: a doctor's note is required to ensure you’re seeking medical guidance to care for your medical condition. If you are taking the time to care for an immediate family member, the doctor’s note is to ensure you are the primary caregiver causing you to be absent from work. The note does not need to contain any medical information. Confirmation of the medically recommended leave duration and/or the primary caregiver status is sufficient.

#### **Q: Can I work part-time during my medical leave and thereby extend it longer than 12-weeks?**

- A: We accommodate such requests as required by local laws, or through our interactive ADA process.

##### **Q: Can I extend my LOA past 4 weeks?**

- A: You may take a total of 12-weeks of LOA with approval from your manager and the People Team. Please remember: the first 4-weeks are paid, and any additional time off is unpaid. If you plan to extend your leave past 4 weeks, please make sure you 1) notify the People Team at people-ops@sourcegraph.com of your request for additional time off and, if approved, 2) update your return-to-work date and out-of-office plan, if need be.
- Please note:
  - Sourcegraph’s Medical Leave policy is intended to ensure you receive full salary for at least 4 weeks and up to an additional 8 weeks unpaid following a medical condition or emergency. However, some country-mandated sick leave laws may give eligible employees the right to take leave for longer than 12 weeks, potentially on a reduced pay or unpaid basis. If you are eligible for statutory leave that is longer than 12 weeks, we will work with you to clarify how our Medical Leave policy works in conjunction with your statutory sick leave. Just so there’s no confusion: this Medical Leave policy will not limit your rights to take your full statutory sick leave.
  - For any requests regarding extended leave due to medical reasons or statutory requirements, please contact the People Team at [people-ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com).

**Q: What if I need to be out on leave for more than 12 weeks?**

- A: Sourcegraph's LOA accommodates for a maximum length of 12 weeks, unless statutory leave is more. If you require more than 12 weeks of leave, Sourcegraph will evaluate if we can accommodate additional unpaid time off through the ADA interactive process, or explore alternative options. This will be determined on a case by case basis. To submit a request for leave surpassing 12-weeks, please email the People Team at people-ops@sourcegraph.com.

##### **Q: Can I use PTO after 4 weeks of medical leave?**

- A: No, while you’re out on medical leave your first 4 weeks will be paid and any additional time off up to 8 additional weeks is unpaid, unless your local statutory annual leave provides otherwise. Once you return to work you can use PTO in alignment with our [Paid Time Off policy](time-off/index.md).

#### **Q: What if I have questions about benefits such as FMLA or ADA, who should I reach out to?** (this only applies to US Employees)

- A: If the teammate is eligible for time off under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or any other applicable leave law in their jurisdiction, time off under this policy will run concurrent with that statutory leave. In addition, more robust medical certification forms may apply for FMLA and other statutory leaves. Your Tilt Leave Case Manager will walk you through this.

#### **Q: Do I need to qualify for FMLA to take a Medical Leave of Absence?**

- A: No, but if you do qualify for FMLA it will run concurrently with your statutory benefits and Medical Leave.

#### **Q: What if I have already exhausted my FMLA (12 weeks) through parental leave this year?**

- A: You may still qualify for medical leave if:
  - You provide the proper doctor documentation
  - You have not taken 12 weeks of medical leave (excluding parental leave) in the last 12 months

##### **Q: I just joined recently. Am I eligible for medical leave even though I haven’t been here for a year?**

- A: Yes! We do not have a waiting period for Medical Leave.

##### **Q: I’ve been working with a therapist, can they write me the required doctor's note?**

- A: To be eligible for leave under this policy, you need to submit a note from a medical doctor (a psychiatrist is a medical doctor, but a psychologist, therapist, or counselor is not). If you instead have a note from your therapist, we will consider it in determining an appropriate accommodation such as unpaid time off.

##### **Q: Is my mental health condition/concerns covered by medical leave?**

- A: Yes, medical leave is for both mental and physical health conditions. The important part is you are working with a medical provider to address your health concern/condition and they are willing to provide you with a doctor’s note for leave.

##### **Q: What happens to my promotion eligibility and Impact Review score?**

- A: Time taken on medical leave will not be factored into (e.g. not counted toward, nor negatively impact) internal mobility and/or promotion eligibility. Upon return from leave, promotion eligibility will resume; there is not a restart on the timeline. Please work with your Manager and People Partner to align on expectations and timeline based on your role and segment. If over the 6-month review period, there are fewer than 4-months of on-the-job performance to assess, the Teammate will retain the rating from the immediately previous cycle. Please reach out to your People Partner for questions related to Teammates on leave.

**Q:** **What happens to my Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) if I go out on leave?**

- A:The progression of your PIP will be based on the amount of PIP completed the length of your leave. We will connect on your return to connect on any ramp period and goals of your remaining PIP. Each situation will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

##### **Q: Does the same LOA policy apply to me if I’m a caregiver for a family member experiencing a medical condition?**

- A: Yes, the same Medical Leave policy and benefits apply to teammates caring for an immediate family member if the teammate is the primary caregiver during the medical condition. An immediate family member includes: child, spouse, parent. If you’re seeking leave to care for family outside of your immediate family please contact People-Ops.

##### **Q: What if my leave start date or return-to-work date changes?**

- A: Please notify the People Team at people-ops@sourcegraph.com with your updated leave start date or return-to-work-date as soon as possible, and we will guide you on who else you need to inform depending on your location and employment status (PEO or Contractor), and whether approval is required.

##### **Q: I’m expecting a new child, is that covered by our LOA policy?**

- A: Yes, our LOA policy covers any medical or disability leave during pregnancy. For post-birth parental leave, see our [Sourcegraph’s Paid Parental Leave Policy](parental-leave.md).

#### **FAQ for US-based Teammates**

##### **Q: Can I change my health plans during medical leave? _(this only applies to US employees)_**

- A: This is unlikely as you must experience a Qualifying Life Event (QLE) to be eligible to change your health care plans. Please find a list of QLEs in [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/insurance/employee/) for more information.

##### **Q: If I have questions about benefits such as FMLA or CFRA, who should I reach out to? _(this only applies to US Employees)_**

- A: Please reach out to the People Team (people-ops@sourcegraph.com).

#### **Q: What happens to withholdings from my paychecks while I’m on leave?**

- A: For the paid portion of leave, medical benefit (including health, dental, vision, and life insurance) premiums will be paid by the Company while you’re on leave. Voluntary contributions (such as 401k, FSA, or HSA) will continue to be deducted from your paid leave benefit as if you were receiving your regular paychecks unless you adjust your withholdings in Rippling and Human Interest.
- For the unpaid portion of leave, you will continue to have medical benefits through Sourcegraph. If you have premium deductions they will be removed from your first paycheck when you return to work.
  - This includes FSA/HSA deduction catch-up or retroactive deductions. If you have an FSA or HSA deduction any missed deductions from lack of paycheck will all be removed from your first paycheck back.
  - 401K deductions will begin as normal on your first paycheck upon return. There are no retroactive deductions applied like FSA/HSA deductions.
- After 12 weeks, subject to applicable local laws including any reasonable disability accommodations, all benefits including medical benefits will discontinue. You will be offered continuation health insurance through COBRA. The People Team will review medically supported extension requests for up to 60 days at a time.
- If you have questions please contact People-Ops.

#### **Q: Should my leave be managed through Sparrow or Tilt?**

A: If you have an active or upcoming leave that was registered with Sparrow prior to 2023-09-01, you will continue to keep your leave with Sparrow. If you need to initiate a leave of absence request on or after 2023-09-01, you will work with Tilt to manage your leave.

#### **Q: How do I login to Tilt?**

A: You access Tilt through [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/identity/mfa-recommendation). You will see a Tilt tile.

#### **Q: Who do I contact if I’m having trouble with Tilt?**

A: You can reach out to the [People-Ops team](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com) or Tilt support.

#### **Q: Why do only US-based teammates use Tilt?**

A: Tilt only provides services to the US at this time. The People-Ops team will support our international teammates throughout their leave of absence process.

#### **Q: How do I know if I’m exempt or non-exempt?**

A: If you are a salaried employee, you are exempt. If you are an hourly employee, you are non-exempt.

#### **Q: What if I work more than 40 hours a week?** _Should I edit the pre-populated number of working hours portion of the Tilt questionnaire?_

A: If you are hourly, yes please adjust the pre-populated hours. If you are salaried, there is no need to make edits as you are paid the same wages and do not receive overtime.

#### **FAQ for non-US-based Teammates**

##### **Q: What if my country of residence has statutory medical or sick or caregiver leave that differs from Sourcegraph’s Medical Leave policy? Which do I follow? _(International teammates only)_**

A: International teammates are entitled to take any statutorily-provided sick leave for which they are eligible. We recognize that as a global company we need to account for variances in country-specific statutory sick leave. Our goal is to ensure, irrespective of the country-specific statutory policy, that all Sourcegraph teammates have at least 4 weeks paid and up to an additional 8 week unpaid medical/sick leave. Some countries may provide specific sick leaves that are longer than up to 12 weeks, in which case teammates will receive the greater entitlement, but it will not be duplicative of Sourcegraph’s leave policy. The focus of our Medical Leave policy is to ensure that all teammates are enabled to take time off during a medical event to focus on their healing and recovery.

##### **Q: Where can I find additional information on medical leave benefits for my specific country? _(International teammates only)_**

A: This is dependent on whether you are employed via a PEO or engaged as a Contractor. Depending on the type of working relationship, there may be variances to how specific statutory parental leave benefits are accounted for.

If you are employed through Deel:

- [Deel’s global hiring guide](https://www.letsdeel.com/global-hiring-guide) provides details for all country specific employment requirements and regulations.
- Contact: support@deel.com for any additional information or clarification of your country specific policy. Please Cc people-ops@sourcegraph.com on your support request.

If you are engaged as an International Contractor:

- Each country has varying requirements that dictate eligibility for statutory medical/sick benefits. This is dependent on the working relationship type including, independent contractors and those who are self-employed. Given the varying country specific regulations, please contact people-ops@sourcegraph.com to receive guidance regarding statutory requirements you are eligible for and how Sourcegraph will cover any variances in total applicable paid leave to ensure you are getting the full 4 weeks of paid medical/sick leave.

### Resources for Quota-Carrying Teammates (Sales & CE)

We want our quota-carrying teammates to feel supported while out on medical leave. This includes Account Executives, Sales Development Representatives, Customer Engineers and quota-carrying Managers. Please contact people-ops@sourcegraph.com to confirm if your role qualifies as a quota-based position.

_Please note that the intent of this policy is to ensure that quota-carrying individuals are supported in taking the time they need in order to treat and heal from their medical condition. Therefore, the below guidelines are subject to leadership discretion in order to accommodate each individual’s unique circumstances. In addition, **this policy is subject to local laws.**_

#### Account Executive Resources

_Note: AEs taking LOA for a period less than 4-weeks are not eligible for the below commission coverage plan._

#### Account Executive Resources - Quota while on leave

For account executives taking 1 month (4-7 weeks) of leave:

- Quota-carrying teammates will be paid no less than 100% of their **base** during the first 4 weeks of leave.
- Quota-carrying teammates will also be paid their average monthly commission from the prior 12 months as a one time monthly payment and no reduced quota while on leave. Example: If an AE earned a total of $120,000 in commissions over the prior 12 month period; the average monthly commission rate will be $10,000. This average rate will be applied as one time payment for Month 1 of the leave period. If in this month the AE’s commission earned is greater than $10,000, ex: $12,000, then the AE will receive the earned commission of $12,000. If the actual commission is $8,000, the AE will receive instead $10,000 given the average commission rate is greater than earned commission for the leave month.
- Any deals booked during this period will be measured against attainment based on the [below criteria](#bookmark=id.i5313qqo5t94).
- Should your attainment exceed 100% of your OTE you will get your commission and accelerators as outlined in the compensation plan (irrespective of the coverage amount or quota reductions).

For account executives taking 2-3 months (8-12 weeks) of leave:

- Pay: any leave that extends beyond 4 weeks will be **unpaid leave** (0% base and 0% guaranteed variable).
- Commissions: applicable commission payout scenarios apply as [outlined below](#bookmark=id.i5313qqo5t94). Teammates will be paid on earned commission up to 12-weeks of medical leave. If your leave extends longer than 12-weeks, commissions will no longer be applicable; please reference guidance [here.](#bookmark=id.aesanfrhc1df)
- Ramp: upon return, you will be eligible for ramp dependent on the length of your leave (duration of ramp can be found below). You will **not have a reduced quota** while on leave.
  - 1 month leave (between 4 - 7 weeks) of leave **will not receive ramp**
  - 2 months leave (between 8-11 weeks) of leave will receive 1 month of ramp at 50%
  - 3 month leave (12 weeks\*) of leave will receive 2 months of ramp at 50%

For account executives taking greater than 3 months (12-weeks) of leave:

- Medical leave with a duration greater than 12 weeks is **not eligible** under the medical leave policy. However, Sourcegraph may grant additional unpaid time off to reasonably accommodate teammates where medically necessary.
- After 12-weeks of leave, quota-carrying teammates are no longer eligible to receive commission splits and the territory will be fully transferred to another teammate.

#### Account Executive Resources - Commission Payout Scenarios

_The below guidance applies for medical leave that is >4 weeks. Deal stage is locked at the start date of teammate’s medical leave. To determine the locked deal stage, we will work with your manager and Pre-Sales Customer Engineer._

_For purposes of clarification, the following terms shall be used:_

- AE on leave: the teammate who is taking medical leave
- Covering AE: the teammate assigned to manage the impacted accounts during the medical leave period
- Opportunities: inclusive of both new business opportunities as well as new expansion & renewal opportunities

Accelerators:

- The teammate will receive credit and commissions as specified in their existing Commission Plan for deals that occur _prior_ to the start of the leave. Accelerators are only applicable over 100% of the standard fully-ramped quota and will not be applied to the reduced quota on leave.

- The teammate on leave will retain all accounts in their name, irrespective of opportunity stage or timing. They will continue to retain those accounts when they return from LOA within a given fiscal year period. In rare cases, there may be extenuating circumstances that require mid-year territory changes. These will be in leadership’s discretion and addressed on a case-by-case basis. The opportunity ownership between AE on leave and covering AE will be as referenced in the above guidelines.

_Examples:_

1. No opportunities are generated or booked in the account while the Teammate is on leave. Teammate will retain the account when they return.
2. Teammate on leave has as Stage 1-4 opportunity passed to another AE. The account stays in the leave Teammate’s name while covering AE will own closure of the opportunity. If the opportunity is booked while the Teammate is on leave, the above commission structure will be referenced, and the account will continue to stay in the name of the Teammate.

### **Before the leave happens**

Please partner with your People Partner and People Operations (people-ops@sourcegraph.com) for the step by step process for a leave of absence.

Step 1: Conversation with Teammate

- This can be a scary and vulnerable conversation for teammates to bring up. Please reassure them Sourcegraph is here to support them.
- Understand employees only need to disclose what they feel comfortable sharing. **Do not** ask about a diagnosis and symptoms they are experiencing. Anything the teammate chooses to share with you or the People Team is confidential. It should not be shared with anyone other than the People Team.
- You can ask if/how you can support them.
- Make sure they’re aware of all the ways in which we provide support by connecting them with their People Partner and/or the People-Ops Team (people-ops@sourcegraph.com).

Step 2: Notify your People Partner and People-Ops ([people-ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com)) if a teammate has requested a medical leave:

- To make sure your teammate gets all the support they need, please ensure you connect the teammate with their People Partner & People-Ops via email ([people-ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com))
- People-Ops will keep you updated through the intake process, and every step along the way up to the teammate returning to work.

Step 3: Arrange out of office coverage:

- Ask the teammate to start working on their [Out of Office Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XfFl_JbyheCLIobG5gWhKvLibmPxZ5odt0_qgfya_3I/edit).
- If you need a temporary worker, please [submit a request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYwWlI_4bKKSkhWq4FrLNE2MPEhRtiq91GtEC6RuFAt-mgfA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### **During leave**

- Keep a running list in your 1:1 agenda of any significant updates to cover when your direct report is back from leave.
- Do not contact the teammate about work tasks while they are out on leave. If you have an urgent question for them, please contact the People Team.
- If you would like to check-in on them personally, you are welcome to do so without discussing work specific topics.

### **Returning to work**

Schedule a check-in with your direct report on their first day back

- Personal check-in
- Questions
  - How are you doing/feeling?
  - How can I best support you during your transition back?
- Resources
  - The People Team
  - Modern Health [link to resources above]
- Professional check-in
  - Review their [Out of Office Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XfFl_JbyheCLIobG5gWhKvLibmPxZ5odt0_qgfya_3I/edit) and 1-1 doc to catch them up to speed.
  - Discuss their availability throughout the day as they return to work.

Make yourself available during their first week back:

- Schedule additional 1-1s or office hours for your direct report to be able to easily reach out to you for help or support as they transition back into work.
- Recognize that returning teammates may need additional support as they transition back. Work with your returning teammate to provide reasonable support beyond the first week as they ramp back up.
