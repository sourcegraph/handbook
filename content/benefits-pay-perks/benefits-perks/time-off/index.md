# Paid time off (PTO) and working hours

At Sourcegraph, every teammate has agency over how they create a balance between work and rest, so that we can stay productive and innovative over the long term.

This balance looks different from person to person and may be reliant on a number of factors, including a teammate’s preferred working style, location, and family obligations. For that reason, we empower our teammates to have agency over their working times, the vacations they take, the time they need to recharge or recover from being sick, and the number of hours they can put in over any week without losing focus or motivation.

Read more about our **[working hours philosophy here](../../../company-info-and-process/working-at-sourcegraph/working-hours.md).**

Here are some basic guidelines to help our teammates navigate their paid time off for rest, paid time off for reasons other than rest, and working hours.

**Please visit this page to see how to submit your PTO**: [submitting time off](submitting-time-off.md).

- **Important**: please record all of your PTO (including public holidays) in Roots as far in advance as possible to notify your manager. If you have any questions about recording PTO in Roots, please contact people-ops@sourcegraph.com or drop your question in [#ask-people-team](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/CQAGQKC4A) in Slack.

## Paid time off (for rest)

Our company-wide policy is unlimited paid time off in exchange for achieving work outcomes that impact our success, but we encourage our teammates to take a minimum of 30 days total paid time off for rest in a calendar year. Your total paid time off refers to vacation days, bank/public holidays, and religious days, and you can mix these days up as they best suit you, but remember that the intention is for you to disconnect and get rest.

- Local guidance on bank/public holidays and religious days: you’re entitled to all the holidays celebrated in your country of residence and/or by your religious denomination, and it is assumed you will be taking paid time off on these days. If you choose to work one of these public holidays, you may exchange them for another day, just update your availability status accordingly.
- Local guidance on vacation days: please ensure you comply with your resident country’s legislated minimum vacation days.

## Paid time off (for other reasons, including being ill)

- **Wellbeing leave**: we trust you to practice agency over your wellbeing, and provide wellbeing leave to take if you are ill (sick) or need time away from work to regulate your mental or physical wellbeing. Additional wellbeing leave is also warranted if you’ve been stretched in supporting your team through growth, so that you can recalibrate.
  (If you're unsure whether it's appropriate to put in time off because you're sick but it's easy to work from your bed, we encourage you to apply this thinking, which was offered by one of our teammates: if you'd avoid going into the office because of how you were feeling, take paid time off and rest at home.)
- **Life leave**: we understand that sometimes “life happens” and you’ll need time off to do things that are not necessarily restful. This could include caring for a family member, bereavement, immigration or legal appointments, taking a pet to the vet, or moving homes.

**Important**: please record all of your PTO (including public holidays) in [Roots](submitting-time-off.md) as far in advance as possible to notify your manager. If you have any questions about recording PTO in Roots, please contact people-ops@sourcegraph.com or drop your question in [#ask-people-team](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/CQAGQKC4A) in Slack.

If you need extended time that will impact your ability to deliver your work or may affect your teammates, seek guidance from your manager so we can understand how to support you.
