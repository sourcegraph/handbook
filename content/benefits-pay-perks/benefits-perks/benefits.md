Others eligible for benefits include:

- Your legal spouse or domestic partner,

## Health benefits we offer

Medical / Dental / Vision Benefits

Life Insurance Benefits

- We offer basic life insurance and cover the full premium for all US-based full-time employees.

## Enrollment

This is your once-a-year chance to enroll in or make changes to your employer-sponsored health plan. You must enroll either upon joining Sourcegraph and/or during Sourcegraph's annual open enrollment period.

During enrollment

- You must elect or decline benefits
- You may add or drop dependents
- You may set contributions to tax-advantaged accounts

You cannot make changes outside of open enrollment unless you have a qualifying life event (QLE).

#### New hire benefits enrollment:

All full-time, US-based Teammates are eligible for benefits. Insurance benefits for US-based Teammates become active on your start date.

US-based new hires have 30 days from their start date to enroll in insurance coverage through [Rippling](https://help.rippling.com/s/article/360056300693). You will receive a [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/login) invite at your personal email by your first week. You will use Rippling to find your pay stubs and tax forms, set up your payment information and employment eligibility (I-9), and select your health insurance plans. If you do not have an invite to Rippling by your first week, please contact the People Team in [#ask-people-team](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/ask-people-team) in Slack or [people-ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com).

You can waive your insurance coverage through [Rippling](https://help.rippling.com/s/article/360056300693). Insurance coverage is automatically waived for any teammate who doesn’t select insurance during their first 30 days.

#### Changes to personal information

Updates to the following information must be noted **in both Bamboo and [Rippling](https://help.rippling.com/s/article/360056300693)**:
An employee’s name, address, phone number, gender, Social Security Number, or date of birth, as well as updates to a dependent’s name, relationship type, gender, Social Security Number, or date of birth.

## **2024 Open enrollment:**

**What:** Open Enrollment is your once-a-year opportunity to review and change your plans, add/or remove dependents, and review your costs and contribution for benefits in the coming year. Outside of open enrollment, you can only make changes to your insurance if you have a “qualified life event” - such as a marriage, or the birth of a child. You can find a recording of our Open Enrollment Session [here](https://sequoiaconsulting.zoom.us/rec/play/BNQTGICUcqsIfjgDvVGMFkX_OTyRC32fJCsTzbNEnAMwJhklnmDF7gQDsEPpdjvY_HGCcE_6eYjR6YZ4.Q-LDyHze0pfXMudh?canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&continueMode=true&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fsequoiaconsulting.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2F080yjjFM2_M3BCFAU-L3575kb7jda6FrIbVJ9uj6NhF3C1kt-pwu4xtOVLq6iZOr.o8DQVS7yWBcb68s5).

**When:** Sourcegraph’s 2024 US Benefits open enrollment took place from <span style="text-decoration:underline;">2023-11-20</span> to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">2023-12-01</span>.

- **Note:** If you start at Sourcegraph during open enrollment Rippling will walk you through new hire enrollment for 2023 benefits **and** open enrollment for 2024 benefits. If you start after 2023-12-01 Rippling will also walk you through **both** new hire enrollment and a special open enrollment window.

**How:** To make changes to current benefit elections, or confirm existing elections, please follow instructions in your [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/) account (use the taskbar on the left-hand side to navigate to the heart icon labeled “insurance and benefits.” From here, you should see the option to start your plan selections).
