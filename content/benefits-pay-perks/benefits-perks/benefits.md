US-based Teammates are eligible for health benefits, which are determined jointly by the People and Finance teams on an annual basis. Our benefit plans and information can all be found [Sequoia](#benefits-support).

## Eligibility

All US-based full-time employees and their dependents are eligible for health benefits through Sourcegraph. Benefits are effective on your date of hire.

Others eligible for benefits include:

- Your legal spouse or domestic partner,
- Your unmarried dependent children up until age 26 (including legally adopted and stepchildren), and/or
- Any dependent child who reaches the limiting age and is incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability.

## Health benefits we offer

Medical / Dental / Vision Benefits

- We offer high-quality medical, dental, and vision care for all US-based full-time employees and their dependents. Sourcegraph covers 100% of premiums for medical, dental, and vision insurance for employees and dependents (for US-based full-time employees).

Life Insurance Benefits

- We offer basic life insurance and cover the full premium for all US-based full-time employees.

## Enrollment

This is your once-a-year chance to enroll in or make changes to your employer-sponsored health plan. You must enroll either upon joining Sourcegraph and/or during Sourcegraph's annual open enrollment period.

During enrollment

- You must elect or decline benefits
- You may add or drop dependents
- You may set contributions to tax-advantaged accounts

You cannot make changes outside of open enrollment unless you have a qualifying life event (QLE).

#### New hire benefits enrollment:

All full-time, US-based Teammates are eligible for benefits. Insurance benefits for US-based Teammates become active on your start date.

US-based new hires have 30 days from their start date to enroll in insurance coverage through [Rippling](https://help.rippling.com/s/article/360056300693). You will receive a [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/login) invite at your personal email by your first week. You will use Rippling to find your pay stubs and tax forms, set up your payment information and employment eligibility (I-9), and select your health insurance plans. If you do not have an invite to Rippling by your first week, please contact the People Team in [#ask-people-team](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/ask-people-team) in Slack or [people-ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com).

You can waive your insurance coverage through [Rippling](https://help.rippling.com/s/article/360056300693). Insurance coverage is automatically waived for any teammate who doesn’t select insurance during their first 30 days.

#### 2023 Open enrollment:

**What:** Open Enrollment is your once-a-year opportunity to review and change your plans, add/or remove dependents, and review your costs and contribution for benefits in the coming year. Outside of open enrollment, you can only make changes to your insurance if you have a "qualified life event" - such as a marriage, or the birth of a child.

**When:** Sourcegraph’s 2023 US Benefits open enrollment took place from 2022-11-01 to 2022-11-15.

**How**: To make changes to current benefit elections, or confirm existing elections, please follow instructions in your [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/) account (use the taskbar on the left-hand side to navigate to the heart icon labeled “insurance and benefits.” From here, you should see the option to start your plan selections). Any plan changes, or confirmations, will become effective as of 2023-01-01.
