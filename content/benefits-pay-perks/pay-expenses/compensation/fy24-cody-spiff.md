# Cody bonus/SPIFF to close Q1

Starting today through May 24, we are offering a bonus/SPIFF to every teammate in the company, regardless of role, who helps to close Cody-related IARR.

## AEs + CEs: New business

Every Cody-driven deal that closes (at least Enterprise Starter pricing and at a company of at least 100 developers) is eligible for a bonus of $2k per AE and CE.

## AEs + TAs: Expansion

Any customer where we see usage increases that would cause an IARR expansion that is clearly attributable to Cody usage is eligible for a bonus of $1k to $4k per AE and TA. The bonus will be calculated on a sliding scale, based on the size of the expansion: $1k + [size of expansion] \* 15%, up to a maximum bonus of $4k per person.

## SDRs: New business

Any outbound Cody-related deals (at least Enterprise Starter pricing) that close are eligible for a bonus of $1k per SDR.

## Engineers and PMs

Any Cody-related deals that close (whether new business or expansion that is clearly attributable to Cody) that are directly influenced by an Engineer’s or PM’s involvement will be eligible for a bonus of $1k to $5k, depending on the level of impact. Examples include providing hands-on demos or training, meeting with customers to solve difficult technical problems, building features or solutions for customers, and more.

## Marketing: New business

Any Cody-related deals (at least Enterprise Starter pricing) that close are eligible for a bonus of $500 to the Marketing teammate(s) who sourced those deals where attribution is clear.

## Other

Any Cody-related deals that close (whether new business or expansion that is clearly attributable to Cody) in which our win was directly influenced by another teammate’s involvement (in a way that isn’t part of their standard job expectations) is eligible for a bonus of $500 to $5k, depending on the level of impact.
