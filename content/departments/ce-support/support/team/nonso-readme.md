# Nonso README

### My view on customer support

At its core, support is really about what most of us were taught as kids—be kind to strangers, do all you can to help people and give your best every single time.

### Preferred learning styles

In some cases, reading or hearing something is enough, At other times, I need to watch others do stuff (realtime or video) for it to make sense. Almost always, I need to practice what I have read, heard or watched for it to stick.

### Communication style

I believe that words are powerful both when spoken and written. I have however learned that beyond what is said or written, people tend to trip over how it is said or written and how it makes them feel. I therefore do my best to take people's feelings into account when I communicate but demphasize mine when processing incoming messages so I can stay objective.

### Preferred way to collaborate

I am flexible here. While I prefer to work synchronously with others, I am open to async where required.

### How I approach problems

I ask a lot of questions but I'll often try to find answers myself before reaching out for help.

### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

I am a little uncomfortable about being praised publicly but only because it puts me under pressure to exceed my current achievement and prove to everyone that I am deserving of the acclaim that I have received (if that makes any sense). A private 'Thank you' makes me feel good about myself without having to deal with the extra baggage of people's expectations moving forward.

### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

I am happy to ask for help—but only after I've first tried to find the answer myself without success.

### What I find enjoyable at work

Meeting people, learning new things, solving problems and sharing what I have learned.

### What kind of work do I find easiest to do when

I am definitely a morning person. I prefer to do focused work early in the day when energy and creativity are highest. I'll deal with routine work as it comes.

### How do I feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for me to see and respond to during active hours

I am used to working round the clock but I'm actively working towards maintaining a healthy work-life balance. For this reason, I prefer to leave non-pressing issues till the next day and will only break this rule for an emergency or exception.

### How folks can best show up for me when I seem off

I eventually get over these things and if I believe that my ability to be productive is being hindered, I'll say so. I however appreciate people reaching out to check on me,

### Things I am aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

When I make a mistake or don't have an answer that I am expected to.

### Technical areas of knowledge

Very limited technical skills but I am open to learning as much is required to get the job done. That said, I'm versed in contact centre operations, team management and coaching (if these can be considered technical skills in this environment!)

### Technical areas of interest to learn

Understanding Sourcegraph as a product and becoming a better leader.

### Current personal project

None at the moment. Focued on settling into my current role.

### Something I fear

I sometimes worry about not being good enough or failing at tasks. I however realize that failure is just another rung on the ladder to success and every mistake is an opportunity to grow.

### A quote I like

> Courage is not the absence of fear but the means to overcome it.

-Not sure who said this but it's something that I have found to be true in my life.

### How I eat fries

With a rich sauce and coleslaw on the side. Throw in ketchup for Irish potatoes!

### My sun, moon, and rising signs

Not really sure what this is about. I suppose I'll find out (maybe).
