# Customer Support manager onboarding

Welcome to Sourcegraph, to the Engineering department, and the Customer Support team! This document provides an overview of the outcomes you will achieve while you work on your [onboarding](index.md). The specific tasks in support of these outcomes are found in [Process Street](https://app.process.st/reports). If you ever feel like an outcome is not true, share that with your manager or the team, and we will figure out how to make sure it is true and improve the onboarding for the next new teammate.

As you go through onboarding, take your time. The first few weeks are all about learning, not doing. It will feel like you have nothing to show for your first few weeks and that is by design. It's okay to take your time and just focus on settling in.
