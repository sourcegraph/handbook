# FY22Q4 OKR Plan

Our objective this quarter was to:

**Make providing an effortless customer experience a habit for each application engineer by consistently honoring [our guiding principles](index.md#guiding-principles) and [definitions of success](index.md#we-know-that-we-are-successful-when-we) while maintaining healthy work habits.**

We measured this via the following key results:

- <a name="kr1"></a> Anyone on the team will be able to review all open cases and say “yes” we are honoring [our guiding principles](index.md#guiding-principles) and [definitions of success](index.md#we-know-that-we-are-successful-when-we) at least 95% of the time when measured.
- All application engineers will have a sentiment of at least a 2 in at least 60% of the technical competency areas outlined in our [technical competency matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1npAo9c_yDGreh1KlUgG0qlG6nTNwW39sl4vTmAvwQu0/edit?usp=sharing).
- All application engineers honor their weekly focus day at least 90% of the time and have taken about 20–30 days off by the end of the quarter (about 20 for those who started in June/July; about 30 for those who started in February/March).

We tracked our progress in [our tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bXOm-oj9VyQwQtIvEfTI3ZRlDV2G5mDCTPBVporbQI8/edit?usp=sharing) and here is the end of quarter summary:

- We honored [our guiding principles](index.md#guiding-principles) and [definitions of success](index.md#we-know-that-we-are-successful-when-we) 96% of the time, achieving our intention for this key result.
- Application engineers have a sentiment of at least a 2 in 87% of the technical competency areas outlined in our [technical competency matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1npAo9c_yDGreh1KlUgG0qlG6nTNwW39sl4vTmAvwQu0/edit?usp=sharing).
- Application engineers honored their weekly focus day 80% of the time and 83% of application engineers took about 20–30 days off by the end of the quarter (about 20 for those who started in June/July; about 30 for those who started in February/March). CS leaders now understand how to better coach application engineers to take time off and we very much solved the barriers to honor the focus day ... landing at 80% instead of 90% was due to factors out of the team's control due to COVID impact in the last month of the quarter.

To accomplish our OKR, we...

| #   | Status      | Responsible           | Project        |
| --- | ----------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| 1   | Complete    | CS leadership         | Case reviews   |
| 2   | Complete    | CS leadership         | Healthy habits |
| 3   | In-progress | Application engineers | Enablement     |

## Task details

### 1 Case reviews

- Workgroup: CS leadership
- Facilitator: Nonso
- Details: CS leadership will launch 3 types of case review practices in advance of 2021-12-09 in order to impact KR1:
  1.  Peer reviews (similar to the idea of code reviews)
  2.  Manager reviews (which include self-review)
  3.  Retros on cases that take longer than 2 week to resolve (finishing what we started in Q3)

### 2 Healthy habits

- Workgroup: CS leadership
- Details: CS leadership will dig in with each member of the team to understand what needs to shift (mindset or practices) in order to make it easy to honor taking a focus day and taking time off as needed.

### 3 Enablement

- Workgroup: All application engineers
- Details: Each application engineer will work to complete as many enablement courses as possible and add them to our [enablement](../process/enablement/index.md) page as they complete them. Our goal is to complete the following crash courses by end of December (and then more to come in January!):

  - Perforce (Alex)
  - RDS databases (Amber)
  - GraphQL (Ben)
  - Prometheus (Don)
  - Scaling (Gabe)
  - Code insights (Giselle)
  - Docker/docker-compose migrations (Jason)
  - CodeIntel (Kelvin)
  - Docker/docker-compose deploy (Mariam)
  - Kubernetes migrations (Michael)
  - Marketplace extensions (Stompy)
  - Kubernetes deploy (Warren)

  A crash course is something lasting and referenced from the handbook ... either a video (harder to update over time but also super useful and/or written materials) ... so more like Youtube -- all at the application engineer's preference. It's okay for folks to experiment and see what works.
