# Case Transitions

This page outlines the process for transitioning cases between application engineers. While we strive to keep this to a minimum, there are situations where it makes sense to transition cases mid-workstream. Some examples include clients operating in different timezones, vacation or OOO, regional team shortages, and more. If an application engineer that’s currently assigned to a case determines that they should transfer the case to another application engineer, the following process should be employed.

## Action for the Application Engineer Transition an Active Case

- Add an internal note, using the Case Transition macro and template (details below)
- Update the title of the ticket to start with: NEEDS TRANSITITON
- Leave the ticket status in its current workflow status state
- Send a response to the customer summarizing what steps you’ve taken, what is next, and communicate that you're handing the ticket off to a colleague.
- Unassign yourself from the ticket in Zendesk so it appears in the Unassigned Tickets view in Zendesk to avoid any miss in triaging.
- Post a link to the ticket in the #customer-support-internal channel to notify the team that you need someone to pick it up and why.

## Action for the Application Engineer Picking up the Ticket

- Claim the case in Zendesk
- Thoroughly review the internal notes and build context before continuing the conversation, then let the customer know that you will be helping them moving forward
