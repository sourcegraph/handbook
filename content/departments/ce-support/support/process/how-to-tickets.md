# Engaging Engineering

As an Application Engineer, you will be confronted with tickets that require you to seek help from engineering. You are encouraged to do so! There are a two ways to enlist the help of engineering, largely depending on the nature of the ticket.

## "How To" Tickets

For how-to tickets, you are not required to create a Request for help (RFH) in GitHub. While RFH's are a valuable tool when dealing with complicated issues, they introduce overhead and complexity that isn't necessary for "How To" questions. For these tickets, follow the procedure below:

1. As you normally would, check the [docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com), and [ticket database](https://github.com/sourcegraph/support-tools-internal/tree/main/resolved-tickets) (searchable on `cse-k8s`) for possible solutions.
2. If no solution is found, create a new post in the #customer-support-internal channel in Slack. Start the post with "HTQ:" so that it is searchable in the future.
3. If you still don't have a solution after doing so, create a new post in #ask-engineering in slack. Again, make sure you start the post with "HTQ:" to make it more searchable. Post expiration will be turned off in this channel to accomodate searching for these posts and adding them to "How To" summaries.

## All other tickets

If you discern that a customer issue has more complexity than what could be answered by an engineer in a slack post, and you, nor your teammates have a solution, you may then go through the process of creating an RFH with the appropriate engineering team as outlined [here](engaging-other-teams.md#requests-for-help-rfhs).
