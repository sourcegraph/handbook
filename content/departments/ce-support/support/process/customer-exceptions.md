# Customer exceptions

Sometimes the best thing to do is make an exception from the workflows, methods, and/or practices we put in place to help us scale â€¦ and do something different for a customer. Any exception should be made with careful consideration for the short and long term consequences. So long as we make decisions with eyes wide open, accept the pros and cons, and document our thought process, we can be flexible and get creative when the situation calls for it.

The list and details about any long term and temporary short term exceptions is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YeRxSeVizEJPE1JNA5FG7mIz3ucjSxYXkEBX2XEytJU/edit#).

We also list these exceptions in Zendesk notes. It may seem duplicative to list them in two places, but the Zendesk notes helps in the moment and the Google doc helps us see everything in one place, quickly validate for accuracy/updates, and facilitate a regular audit of information.
