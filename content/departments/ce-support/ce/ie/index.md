#Implementation Engineering (IE)

The Implementation Engineering (IE) team at Sourcegraph reduces time to value for our customers by providing expertise and hands-on service to deploy, install, and configure Sourcegraph within customer environments. IEs work front and center directly with customers, in collaboration with internal teams, to lead the implementation effort. IEs are supported by an Implementation Project Manager who oversees the internal and external tasks, needs, and dependencies across these implementations.
