# Implementation Strategies and Recommendations

There are several potential deployment and implementation strategies that may be used with a customer depending on their deployment type, size, and complexity. Each deployment strategy involves different internal owners and timeline expectations.


### Deployment Strategies

<ul>
<li>Prefered deployment strategy

<li>Once it is determined that the customer qualifies for Cloud, the CE or Sales will submit a <a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/cloud/#managed-instance-requests">Managed Instance Request</a> to the Cloud Team to kick off the process

  <tr>
   <td><em>One-Click Deployment</em>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>
<li>Prefered on-prem deployment method

<li>The production environment for the customer is created by the CE prior to transitioning ownership of the account to the TAM

<li>The production environment could be initiated as part of a trial or POC, or it could be created following contract closure
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
   <td>CE
   </td>

  <tr>
   <td><em>Jointly Managed Deployment</em>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>
<li>If Cloud and One-Click are not options for the customer, the CE will <a href="https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/ce-support/ce/ie/ce-implementation-handoff/#initiating-an-ie-request">Initiate an IE Request</a>

<li>Upon reviewing the request, the implementation team qualifies the customer for a jointly managed deployment and kicks off the process with the CE and Sales

<li>This method is primarily used for on-prem Kubernetes deployments
</li>

   <td><em>One-Click Into Jointly Managed Deployment</em>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>
<li>This method is only used by customers that would like a production environment stood up quickly, their initial user set can be supported by a One-Click Deployment, but a full Kubernetes instance will be needed for expansion to the full set of users

<li>The CE will stand up an initial One-Click production environment and transition the customer to the TAM for continued support

<li>As the deployment reaches scalability or technical limits, the TAM engages the implementation team to coordinate a post-live, jointly managed Kubernetes deployment
