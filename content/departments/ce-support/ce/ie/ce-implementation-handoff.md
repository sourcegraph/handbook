# Overview
This document is a work in progress to give an overview of the expectations of the handoff between the customer engineering team and the implementation engineering team when a new customer signs and requires implementation support.

# Documentation requirements for handoff
As a prerequisite to a handoff from Customer Engineering and Sales to Implementation, the implementation team must review and sign off on the [Technical Design Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vjETRXdUtLSTRrnMAuN6aEbR_Xx0qHacONrnI0zoPyc/edit#heading=h.y9pic5x93a9l) written by the Customer Engineer. This will give the Implementation team a much clearer understanding of the scope of the deployment as it was agreed upon between the customer and Sourcegraph.

In the event the customer has different requirements for their production deployment from the trial outlined in the TDD, the production requirements should be documented in the TDD in a separate section.

# Customer introductions and other communication
### External Communications
For new customers that will require implementation team support for their deployment, it is the customer engineerâ€™s responsibility to introduce the implementation engineer and project manager (if one is assigned) leading the deployment to the customer. This would preferably be done via a meeting, but can be done over email if that is more appropriate for the given customer. Regardless, there should be active messaging to the customer that they will be working with an implementation engineer and project manager for the production deployment and who those people will be. The implementation team should be included on these communications.

### Internal Communications
When the customer has signed, the internal stakeholders on the project should hold a meeting to make sure any context is passed from the pre-sales team to the implementation team. This meeting is primarily to go through the TDD and ensure there is no loss of info in the handoff from the pre-sales team.

# Expectations for AE/CE to set before handoff
During the late stages of closing a deal, it is imperative that the pre-sales team is setting the stage correctly for the implementation team to be successful. The AE and CE on the account should be clearly communicating what customers should expect when working with the implementation team. In addition, the Implementation Project Manager should be brought in on calls to help begin identifying a project plan for the deployment.

This includes:
- Deployment Timeline
- Meeting Cadence with Customer Leadership and Project Team Members
- Project Staffing and Key Stakeholder Identification and Engagement
- Progress Reporting Expectations
- Key Implementation Activities Review
- Roles and Responsibilities Level-Setting
- Implementation Prerequisites
- Scope and Timeline Sign-Off
