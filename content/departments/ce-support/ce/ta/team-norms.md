# TA Team Norms

## Recurring Team Meetings

This team is highly focused on engaging our customers with valuble insight and information. We also are focused on internally surfacing customer information that is important to the business. This means both synchronous customer conversations throughout the day along with synchronous and asynchronous Sourcegraph processes.

Any daily / weekly / monthly team activities will be defined at a later time.
