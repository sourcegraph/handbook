# Technical Advisors (TAs)

_Note: this team is being actively formed, and will consist of 7-8 TAs that will expand over time._

## Who we are

Technical Advisors (TA) will serve as specialized technical experts focused on our customers' experience and relationships post-sales. Our mission is to deliver a consistent engagement experience to customers rooted in providing value to them such that they achieve their desired postive business outcomes within their business. We seek to reduce time to initial customer value by training and enabling our dev end users on how to use and integrate Sourcegraph into their workflows. We also strive to help our customers maximize their return on investment (ROI) and do so by continuously monitoring the health of our customers, becoming trusted advisors to them on all things Sourcegraph and engineering, and building out the tools and processes internally to do this job as effectively as possible. We are responsible for ensuring that customers are achieving their success metrics and that they continue to find new valuable use cases for Sourcegraph.

## Team KPIs / Measures of Success

Ultimately we will work to increase the following customer metrics:

- Adoption
- Daily Usage / Consumption
- NPS
- Customer Retention

While those metrics are good for our business, the driving factor should be making that the customer is successful in their own business, and that Sourcegraph is a critical tool in that process that proves invaluable to their organization.
