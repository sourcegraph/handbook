# Technical Advisors (TAs)

## Who we are

Technical Advisors (TA), within Customer Engineering (CE), are specialized experts focused on the post-sales customer experience and relationship. Our team will be responsible for continuously monitoring the health of our customers, becoming trusted advisors to them on all things Sourcegraph and engineering, and building out the tools and processes internally to do this job as effectively as possible. We are responsible for ensuring that customers are achieving their success metrics and that they continue to find new valuable use cases for Sourcegraph.

Note on team initiation: This team is being created iteratively and is the precursor to separating CE responsibilities (currently both pre- and post-sales) into establishing CE as the dedicated pre-sales counterpart to Sales while TAs will be the dedicated post-sales counterpart to Sales. The initial team will be comprised of 5-6 TA's that will expand over time.

## Team KPIs / Measures of Success

Ultimately we will work to increase the following customer metrics:

- Adoption
- Daily Usage / Consumption
- NPS
- Customer Retention

While those metrics are good for our business, the driving factor should be making that the customer is successful in their own business, and that Sourcegraph is a critical tool in that process that proves invaluable to their organization.
