# Customer Engineering

Customer Engineering at Sourcegraph is responsible for the technical success of our customers. To-date the CE organization has been comprised of one functional team that spans both pre- and post-sales - serving as pre-sales engineers, technical implementation engineers, and technical success managers. 

Throughout Q3 FY23 and into Q4 FY23, the CE organization is launching separate, discrete functional teams that will specialize in each of these key areas in the customers' journey:

- Customer Engineers (CEs) - will focus strictly on technical sales and solutioning within new prospects and existing customers
- Implementation Engineers (IEs) - will lead the technical design, installation, configuration, and migration activities for large, complex self-hosted customer deployments.
- Implementation Project Managers (TPMs) - will manage customer self-hosted deployments.
- Technical Advisors (TAs) - partner with our customers post-sales, to deliver value and help customers achieve positive business outcomes throughout their relationship with Sourcegraph.
