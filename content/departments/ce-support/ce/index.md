Customer Engineering at Sourcegraph is oriented around the technical success of our customers. CE is comprised of three separate teams: Customer Engineers (CEs), Customer Training Engineers (CTEs), and Implementation Engineers (IEs). This page contains information relevant to the CE organization as a whole, and each of the links below will take you to subteam-specific pages.
