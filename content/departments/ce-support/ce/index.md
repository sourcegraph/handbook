CE is comprised of four separate teams: Customer Engineers (CEs), Technical Advisors (TAs), Implementation Engineers (IEs), and Implementation Project Managers (TPMs). This page contains information relevant to the CE organization as a whole, and each of the links below will take you to subteam-specific pages.
