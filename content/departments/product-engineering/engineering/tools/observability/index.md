# Observability at Sourcegraph

These pages document Sourcegraph-specific use cases, scenarios, and tools for developing observability, as well as some background information and guiding principles.

For general observability development, please refer to the [observability development documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/observability) instead, which includes links to useful how-to guides.
