# Sourcegraph Cloud observability

We provide some tooling to make [Sourcegraph Cloud](../../process/deployments/instances.md#sourcegraph-cloud) easier to monitor and observe. This includes observability for relevant critical infrastructure such as our [CI/CD pipelines](#ci-logs).

For general observability development, please refer to the [observability development documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/observability) instead, which includes links to useful how-to guides.

> NOTE: Looking for _how to monitor Sourcegraph?_ See the [observability documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/observability).

## Monitoring

For metrics and alerting, see the [Sourcegraph monitoring guide](./monitoring.md).

## Grafana Cloud

We have a Grafana Cloud instance at [sourcegraph.grafana.net](https://sourcegraph.grafana.net/). Accounts are automatically provisioned by logging in with GSuite oAuth. Quick links:

### Logs

Logs in Grafana Cloud is provided by [Grafana Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/), a logs aggregation system that uses a PromQL-like query language called [LogQL](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/).

Loki allows you to easily query for logs, filter for fields within structured logs, and even generate metrics from logs. The [official LogQL documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/) provides a complete reference, or you can refer to [this cheatsheet](https://megamorf.gitlab.io/cheat-sheets/loki/) for a brief overview.

#### Cloud logs

The Loki instance in Grafana Cloud is currently configured to ingest logs from Sourcegraph Cloud pushed from [`grafana-agent`'s Loki configuration](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-cloud/blob/release/configure/grafana-agent/grafana-agent.ConfigMap.yaml#L58). To query these, you can start with a LogQL query like:

```logql
{deploy="sourcegraph",app="sourcegraph-frontend"}
  | logfmt
  | lvl="warn"
```

#### CI logs

The `sourcegraph/sourcegraph` CI pipeline also [uploads pipeline logs using `sg` to Loki](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/enterprise/dev/upload-build-logs.sh). To query these, you can start with a LogQL query like:

```logql
{app="buildkite",branch="main",state="failed"}
  |~ "FAILED:"
```

Also refer to the [CI dashboard](https://sourcegraph.grafana.net/d/iBBWbxFnk/ci?orgId=1) for more examplesâ€”just select a panel and click "Explore" to see the underlying query.

## Cloudflare

This section gives a quick overview of how to access Cloudflare analytics, and how to interface with their GraphQL API. Note that in most cases, you'll be able to get much richer metrics by accessing our [existing monitoring dashboards](monitoring.md) on our own internal monitoring.

## GraphQL API

Cloudflare Analytics provides a somewhat [limited](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/limits) API for retrieving monitoring data. Note that you can only retrieve relatively recent data, and have a limited number of operations.

### Tools

Cloudflare recommends using [GraphiQL](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/graphiql), a lightweight electron app, to interface with their API due to its relative ease of use. Configuration instructions are [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/getting-started). The auth key and email can be found [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/blob/main/dns/providers.tf). The tool also helps enumerate the available parameters, and is quite useful for exploring the API.

### Available data

The Cloudflare API mainly contains network layer information about communications to and from the service. The entire list of datasets is enumerated [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/features/data-sets). For an example, the number of requests and page views per minute, along with the number of unique accessors can be found with the following query. Note that the results are ordered by `datetimeMinute_ASC`, since the default response ordering does not rely on time.

```{
viewer {
    zones(filter: {zoneTag: [ZONE_TAG]}) {
      httpRequests1mGroups(limit: 10000,  filter: {datetime_gt: "2020-10-29T10:00:00Z", datetime_lt: "2020-10-29T20:10:00Z"}, orderBy: [datetimeMinute_ASC]) {
        sum {
          requests
          pageViews
        }
        uniq {
          uniques
        }
        dimensions {
          datetimeMinute
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
