# Hiring manager intro call

This is the first call with a candidate. The goals are to:

- Evaluate the candidate's communication skills and enthusiasm for Sourcegraph.
- Validate the role and the candidate's skills/desired role are aligned.
- Answer any questions that they have.

## What to measure

- Are their career goals aligned with the role such they will feel happy, challenged, and thriving?
- Do their strengths align with what we are looking for in the role?

## Preparation

Review the candidate's resume, application responses, and any other links or information that is relevant (e.g. LinkedIn profile, personal website, etc.) so you don't ask any questions that you should know the answer to.

## Script
