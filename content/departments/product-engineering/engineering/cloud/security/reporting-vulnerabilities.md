# Reporting a vulnerability

Sourcegraph's public bug bounty scheme is closed as of the 31st of March 2022.
We are currently operating an invite-only HackerOne bug bounty program instead.
If you have found a high or critical severity vulnerability in one of our
products, please reach out to security@sourcegraph.com and we will assess whether
the severity of the reported issue merits an invite to the program. Please note
that a report to this email address is no longer considered a submission to the
bounty scheme in itself.
