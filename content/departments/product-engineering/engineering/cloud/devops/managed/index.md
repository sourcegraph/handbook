# Managed instances

This documentation details how the Distribution team at Sourcegraph internally handles the provisioning/creation/configuration/maintenance of [managed instances](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/managed).

Please first read [the customer-facing managed instance documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/managed) to understand what these are and what we provide.

## When to offer a Managed Instance

Managed instances offer a backup alternative for using Sourcegraph when a customer either can't or, for some reason, won't deploy Sourcegraph self-hosted.

As of 2022-03-10, managed instance is not the recommended deployment method for any tier size of customer. We hope to be able to change that in the future.

See below for the SLAs and Technical implementation details (including Security) related to managed instances.

## Managed Instance Requests

Customer Engineers (CE) or Sales may request to:

- **Create a managed instance** - [[Issue Template](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/new?assignees=&labels=team%2Fdelivery&template=new_managed_instance.md&title=)]
  - **After ruling out a self-hosted deployment** and [determining a managed instance is viable for a customer/prospect](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/managed)
  - For new customers or prospects who currently do not have a managed instance.
- **Suspend a managed instance** - [[Issue Template](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/new?assignees=&labels=team%2Fdelivery&template=managed-instance-suspend.md&title=)]
  - For customers or prospects who currently have a managed instance that needs to pause their journey, but intend to come back within a couple of months.
- **Tear down a managed instance** - [[Issue Template](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/new?assignees=&labels=team%2Fdelivery&template=managed-instance-teardown.md&title=)]
  - For customers or prospects who have elected to stop their managed instance journey entirely. They accept that they will no longer have access to the data from the instance as it will be permanently deleted.

### Workflow

1.  Sales alerts their CE partner to seek approval from CE leadership, who will guide next steps
2.  If approved, then CE submits a request to the Delivery team using the corresponding issue template in the [sourcegraph/customer](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer) repo.
3.  Message the team in [#delivery](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02E4HE42BX).

### Incident Response

Incidents which affect managed instances handled according to our [incidents](../../../process/incidents/index.md) process.

## Technical details

![architecture](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/managed-instance-architecture.png)

### Deployment type and scaling

Managed instances are Docker Compose deployments only today. We do not currently offer Kubernetes managed instances.

These managed Docker Compose deployments can scale up to the largest GCP instance type available, n1-standard-96 with 96 CPU / 360 GB memory which is typically enough for most medium to large enterprises.

We do not offer Kubernetes managed instances today as this introduces some complexity for us in terms of ongoing maintenance and overhead, we may revisit this decision in the future.

### Known limitations of managed instances

Sourcegraph managed instances are single-machine Docker-Compose deployments only. We do not offer Kubernetes managed instances, or multi-machine deployments, today.

With that said, Docker Compose deployments can scale up to the largest GCP instance type available, n1-standard-96 with 96 CPU & 360 GB memory, and are typically capable of supporting all but the largest of enterprises (around 25,000 repositories and 3,000 users are supported, based on what we have seen thus far.)

The main limitation of this model is that an underlying GCP infrastructure outage could result in downtime, i.e. is it not a HA deployment.

### Security

- **Isolation**: Each managed instance is created in an isolated GCP project with heavy gcloud access ACLs and network ACLs for security reasons.
- **Admin access**: Both the customer and Sourcegraph personnel will have access to an application-level admin account.
- **VM/SSH access**: Only Sourcegraph personnel will have access to the actual GCP VM, this is done securely through GCP IAP TCP proxy access only. Sourcegraph personnel can make changes or provide data from the VM upon request by the customer.
- **Inbound network access**: The customer may choose between having the deployment be accessible via the public internet and protected by their SSO provider, or for additional security have the deployment restricted to an allowlist of IP addresses only (such as their corporate VPN, etc.)
- **Outbound network access**: The Sourcegraph deployment will have unfettered egress TCP/ICMP access, and customers will need to allow the
  Sourcegraph deployment to contact their code host. This can be done by having their code-host be publicly accessible, or by allowing the static IP of the Sourcegraph deployment to access their code host.
- **Cloudflare protections**: The Sourcegraph deployment, if open to the Internet, will be proxied through Cloudflare and leverage security features such as rate limiting and the Cloudflare WAF.

### Access

- To perform the steps outlined in these docs you will need to be a member of:
  - The google group [gcp-managed](https://groups.google.com/a/sourcegraph.com/g/gcp-managed/members)
  - 1Password Vaults `Customer managed instances` & `Internal managed instances`

Access can be requested in #it-tech-ops WITH manager approval.

### Configuration management

Terraform is used to maintain all managed instances. You can find this configuration here: https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-managed

All customer credentials, secrets, site configuration, app and user configuration—is stored in Postgres only (i.e. on the encrypted GCP disk). This allows customers to enter their access tokens, secrets, etc. directly into the app through the web UI without transferring them to us elsewhere.

## FAQ

### FAQ: Can customers disable the "Builtin username-password authentication"?

Yes, you may disable the builtin authentication provider and only allow creation of accounts from configured SSO providers.

However, in order to preserve site admin access for Sourcegraph operators, we need to add [Sourcegraph's internal Okta](./oidc_site_admin.md) as an authentication provider. Plesae reach out to our team prior disabling the builtin provider.

### FAQ: "googleapi: Error 400: The network_endpoint_group resource ... is already being used"

If `terraform apply` is giving you:

```
Error: Error when reading or editing NetworkEndpointGroup: googleapi: Error 400: The network_endpoint_group resource 'projects/sourcegraph-managed-$COMPANY/zones/us-central1-f/networkEndpointGroups/default-neg' is already being used by 'projects/sourcegraph-managed-$COMPANY/global/backendServices/default-backend-service', resourceInUseByAnotherResource
```

Or similar—this indicates a bug in Terraform where GCP requires an associated resource to be deleted first and Terraform is trying to delete (or create) that resource in the wrong order.

To workaround the issue, locate the resource in GCP yourself and delete it manually and then `terraform apply` again.
