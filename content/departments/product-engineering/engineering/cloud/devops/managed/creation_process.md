# Creating a managed instance

Creating a new [managed instance](./index.md) involves following the steps below.
For basic operations like accessing an instance for these steps, see [managed instances operations](operations.md).

1. CE creates an issue with the managed instance template in the `sourcegraph/customer` repository.
1. Create a new GCP project for the instance by adding it to the [`managed_projects` tfvar in the infrastructure repo's `gcp/projects/terraform.tfvars`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure%24%40main+managed_projects+%3D+%7B+:%5B_%5D+%7D&patternType=structural)
   - It will look something like `sourcegraph-managed-$COMPANY = { ... }` - refer to the existing variables for more details. If you customize the `sourcegraph-managed` prefix, make sure to update the PROJECT_PREFIX variable in the below instructions.
   - Ensure when you run `terraform apply` that you commit and push the `terraform.tfstate` file to github
1. In created GCP project create [Google Oauth credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=sourcegraph-managed-$COMPANY)

- name: `managed-instance-$COMPANY`
- Authorized redirect URIs: `https://$COMPANY.sourcegraph.com/.auth/callback`

1. Create [secret for OIDC login](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager/create?project=sourcegraph-managed-dev) (used by Sourcegraph employees):

- name: `OIDC_JSON`
- scret value:

```
{
  "allowSignup": false,
  "clientID": "<CLIENT_ID_FROM_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS>",
  "clientSecret": "<CLIENT_SECRET_FROM_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS>",
  "displayName": "Sourcegraph Management",
  "issuer": "https://accounts.google.com",
  "requireEmailDomain": "sourcegraph.com",
  "type": "openidconnect"
}
```

1. Clone and `cd deploy-sourcegraph-managed/`
1. Set variables:

   - `export VERSION=v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>`
   - `export COMPANY=$COMPANY`
   - `export PROJECT_PREFIX=sourcegraph-managed` (should match GCP project prefix)
   - `export PROJECT_ID=$PROJECT_PREFIX-$COMPANY`
   - `export TF_VAR_opsgenie_webhook=<OpsGenie Webhook value>`
     - This can be found in the [Managed Instances vault](https://my.1password.com/vaults/nwbckdjmg4p7y4ntestrtopkuu/allitems/d64bhllfw4wyybqnd4c3wvca2m)

1. Check out a new branch: `git checkout -b $COMPANY/create-instance`
1. `./util/create-managed-instance.sh $COMPANY/` and **commit the result**. Make sure that the version exists in [deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tags).
1. Open and edit `terraform.tfvars` according to the TODO comments within and commit the result.

   > NOTE: ⚠️ Do not set `enable_alerting` to `true` yet as this will cause false alerts to fire until the MI creation process has been completed!

1. Ensure you are using the version of Terraform indicated in `.tool-versions` using `tfenv`
1. In `gcp-tfstate` run `terraform init && terraform apply -var-file=../terraform.tfvars && git add . && git commit -m 'initialize GCP tfstate bucket'`

   > NOTE: You can safely ignore the warnings from `terraform apply`.

1. Open and edit `deploy-sourcegraph-managed/$COMPANY/red/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml`, increase `gitserver-0`'s `cpus: 8` if the instance size is larger than "n1-standard-8".
1. In `deploy-sourcegraph-managed/$COMPANY` run `terraform init && terraform apply`
1. Check if instance is ready

```
mg check
```

1. In the infrastructure repository, [create a DNS entry](https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/blob/main/dns/sourcegraph.managed.tf) that points `$COMPANY.sourcegraph.com` to the `default-global-address` IP (see ["Finding the external load balancer IP"](operations.md#finding-the-external-ips)) and follow the process there to `asdf exec terraform apply` it. If the instance is Public, set `proxied` to `true`. If it's Private, set it to `false`.
1. In the GCP web UI under **Network services** > **Load balancers** > select the load balancer > watch the SSL certificate status. It may take some time for it to become active (~1h41m) / for Google to see the DNS change from Cloudflare. Confirm it is active by following ["Access through the GCP load balancer as a user would"](operations.md#access-through-the-gcp-load-balancer-as-a-user-would).
1. Create a PR for review, apply and merge
1. Initialise instance

```
mg init-instance $CUSTOMER_ADMIN_EMAIL
```

1. Navigate to Grafana under `/-/debug/grafana` and confirm the instance looks healthy.
1. In the **global user settings** (not site config), set `"alerts.showPatchUpdates": false`
1. In the site configuration, configure alerting to go to our #alerts-managed-instances Slack channel, for example (replace `$COMPANY` with the actual company name, and `$WEBHOOK_URL` with the actual webhook URL from 1password **Managed instances** > `#alerts-managed-instances Slack webhook URL`):
   ```
     "observability.alerts": [
       {
         "level": "critical",
         "notifier": {
           "type": "slack",
           "username": "$COMPANY",
           "url": "$WEBHOOK_URL"
         }
       },
     ],
   ```
1. In the site configuration, configure password reset emails to expire after 24 hours (instead of the default 4 hours). This allows more time for the customer to set up their initial account and gain access to the instance.
   ```
   "auth.passwordResetLinkExpiry": 86400, // 24 hours
   ```
1. Go back to `terraform.tfvars` and set `enable_alerting` to `true`. Run `terraform apply` and verify that only `google_monitoring_alert_policy.primary` is created.
1. Enable metrics collection and GCP alerts for created Managed Instance via [this action](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-managed/tree/main/monitoring#2-add-new-managed-instances-project-to-be-monitored).
1. Add an entry for the customer by adding their [Accounts](https://github.com/sourcegraph/accounts/) link to the checklist in the [managed instances upgrade issue template](../../../process/releases/upgrade_managed_issue_template.md).

## Giving the customer access

> NOTE: ⚠️ Before providing access to the customer, make sure that the GCP alerting policy has been created!

To provide the customer access to the instance:

1. If IP restrictions are requested, create and apply the Terraform change that grants their IP/CIDR ranges access to the instance, or makes it public/SSO-only, by following the [operations guide](operations.md).
1. Prepare the initial admin account for the customer:
   1. Copy the generated link and provide it to the CE to provide to the customer. Managed instances usually won't have email set up, so a link will not be sent automatically. Keep in mind this link will expire after 4 hours.

## Configuring License, SSO, and repositories

Delivery usually hands off to CE at this point, they will schedule a call with the customer (including a DevOps team member, if needed) to walk the site admin on the customer's side through performing initial setup of the product including adding the license key, adding repos, configuring SSO, and inviting users.
