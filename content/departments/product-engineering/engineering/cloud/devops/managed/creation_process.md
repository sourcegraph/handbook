# Creating a managed instance

Creating a new [managed instance](./index.md) involves following the steps below.
For basic operations like accessing an instance for these steps, see [managed instances operations](operations.md).

1. CE creates an issue with the managed instance template in the `sourcegraph/customer` repository.
1. Create a new GCP project for the instance by adding it to the [`managed_projects` tfvar in the infrastructure repo's `gcp/projects/terraform.tfvars`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure%24%40main+managed_projects+%3D+%7B+:%5B_%5D+%7D&patternType=structural)
   - It will look something like `sourcegraph-managed-$COMPANY = { ... }` - refer to the existing variables for more details. If you customize the `sourcegraph-managed` prefix, make sure to update the PROJECT_PREFIX variable in the below instructions.
   - Ensure when you run `terraform apply` that you commit and push the `terraform.tfstate` file to github
1. Clone and `cd deploy-sourcegraph-managed/`
1. Set variables:

- `export VERSION=v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>`
- `export COMPANY=$COMPANY`
- `export PROJECT_PREFIX=sourcegraph-managed` (should match GCP project prefix)
- `export PROJECT_ID=$PROJECT_PREFIX-$COMPANY`
- `export TF_VAR_opsgenie_webhook=<OpsGenie Webhook value>`
  - This can be found in the [Managed Instances vault](https://my.1password.com/vaults/nwbckdjmg4p7y4ntestrtopkuu/allitems/d64bhllfw4wyybqnd4c3wvca2m)
- `export TF_VAR_cf_origin_cert_base64=$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --project=sourcegraph-dev --secret="SOURCEGRAPH_WILDCARD_CERT" | base64)`
- `export TF_VAR_cf_origin_private_key_base64=$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --project=sourcegraph-dev --secret="SOURCEGRAPH_WILDCARD_KEY" | base64)`

1. Check out a new branch: `git checkout -b $COMPANY/create-instance`
1. `./util/create-managed-instance.sh $COMPANY/` and **commit the result**. Make sure that the version exists in [deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tags).
1. Open and edit `terraform.tfvars` according to the TODO comments within and commit the result.

   | ⚠️ Do not set `enable_alerting` to `true` yet as this will cause false alerts to fire until the MI creation process has been completed! |
   | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

1. Ensure you are using the version of Terraform indicated in `.tool-versions` using `tfenv`
1. In `gcp-tfstate` run `terraform init && terraform apply -var-file=../terraform.tfvars && git add . && git commit -m 'initialize GCP tfstate bucket'`

   | ℹ️ You can safely ignore the warnings from `terraform apply`. |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

1. Open and edit `deploy-sourcegraph-managed/$COMPANY/red/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml`, increase `gitserver-0`'s `cpus: 8` if the instance size is larger than "n1-standard-8".
1. In `deploy-sourcegraph-managed/$COMPANY` run `terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply`
1. Access the instance over SSH and confirm all containers are healthy ([instructions](operations.md#ssh-access)). You may find `docker ps` reports no containers, that indicates it is still installing Docker, etc. To watch this progress see [debugging startup scripts](operations.md#debugging-startup-scripts), it usually takes <10m. Confirm all containers come up healthy (`docker ps` should report them as such)
1. In the infrastructure repository, [create a DNS entry](https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/blob/main/dns/sourcegraph.managed.tf) that points `$COMPANY.sourcegraph.com` to the `default-global-address` IP (see ["Finding the external load balancer IP"](operations.md#finding-the-external-ips)) and follow the process there to `asdf exec terraform apply` it. If the instance is Public, set `proxied` to `true`. If it's Private, set it to `false`.
1. Create a PR for review.
1. Create admin credentials in 1password:
   - Open the 1password [Managed instances vault](https://my.1password.com/vaults/l35e5xtcfsk5suuj4vfj76hqpy/allitems) (if necessary, access can be requested in #it-tech-ops)
   - **Add** > **Login** > enter **$COMPANY sourcegraph-admin** as the title
     - **User:** `managed+$COMPANY@sourcegraph.com`
     - **Password:** Change **length** to 40 and turn on symbols and digits > **Save**
1. Access the Sourcegraph web UI ([instructions for port-forwarding](operations.md#port-forwarding-direct-access-to-caddy-jaeger-and-grafana))
1. Set up the initial admin account (for use by the Sourcegraph team only)
   - Email: `managed+$COMPANY@sourcegraph.com` (note `+` sign not `-`)
   - Username: `sourcegraph-admin`
   - Password: Use the password previously created and stored in 1password.
1. Create a token for the account under `/users/sourcegraph-admin/settings/tokens` called `managed-instances` and add it as "token" under the 1password entry for the admin account.
1. Navigate to Grafana and confirm the instance looks healthy.
1. Configure `externalURL` in the site configuration, and use SSH to restart the server (`sudo su`, `shutdown -r`) wait for it to come back up and access it again.
1. In the **global user settings** (not site config), set `"alerts.showPatchUpdates": false`
1. In the GCP web UI under **Network services** > **Load balancers** > select the load balancer > watch the SSL certificate status. It may take some time for it to become active (~1h41m) / for Google to see the DNS change from Cloudflare. Confirm it is active by following ["Access through the GCP load balancer as a user would"](#access-through-the-gcp-load-balancer-as-a-user-would).
1. Go back to `terraform.tfvars` and set `enable_alerting` to `true`. Run `terraform plan && terraform apply`.
1. In the site configuration, configure alerting to go to our #alerts-managed-instances Slack channel, for example (replace `$COMPANY` with the actual company name, and `$WEBHOOK_URL` with the actual webhook URL from 1password **Managed instances** > `#alerts-managed-instances Slack webhook URL`):
   ```
     "observability.alerts": [
       {
         "level": "critical",
         "notifier": {
           "type": "slack",
           "username": "$COMPANY",
           "url": "$WEBHOOK_URL"
         }
       },
     ],
   ```
1. In the site configuration, configure password reset emails to expire after 24 hours (instead of the default 4 hours). This allows more time for the customer to set up their initial account and gain access to the instance.
   ```
   "auth.passwordResetLinkExpiry": 86400, // 24 hours
   ```
1. Add an entry for the customer by adding their [Accounts](https://github.com/sourcegraph/accounts/) link to the checklist in the [managed instances upgrade issue template](../../../process/releases/upgrade_managed_issue_template.md).

## Giving the customer access

| ⚠️ Before providing access to the customer, make sure that the GCP alerting policy has been created! |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

To provide the customer access to the instance:

1. If IP restrictions are requested, create and apply the Terraform change that grants their IP/CIDR ranges access to the instance, or makes it public/SSO-only, by following the [operations guide](operations.md).
1. Prepare the initial admin account for the customer:
   1. Go to `/site-admin/users` and hit "Create user", and fill in the appropriate values. (The email address should be in the original managed instance Issue created by CE.)
   1. Copy the generated link and provide it to the CE to provide to the customer. Managed instances usually won't have email set up, so a link will not be sent automatically. Keep in mind this link will expire after 4 hours.
   1. Go to `/site-admin/users` and promote the created account to site admin.

## Configuring License, SSO, and repositories

Delivery usually hands off to CE at this point, they will schedule a call with the customer (including a DevOps team member, if needed) to walk the site admin on the customer's side through performing initial setup of the product including adding the license key, adding repos, configuring SSO, and inviting users.
