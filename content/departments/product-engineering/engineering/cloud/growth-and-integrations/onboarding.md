# New Team Member Onboarding

In addition to [Sourcegraph's general onboarding](../../../../../company-info-and-process/onboarding/index.md) there are some specific tasks and material relevant to the Growth and Integrations team.

## Tools

### Google groups

Where possible we try to organize our meetings by inviting groups rather than individuals. Consequently, make sure you are part of the [Growth and Integrations Google group](https://groups.google.com/a/sourcegraph.com/g/growth-and-integrations/members?pli=1). If you're not, reach out to one of the team members to help.

### Slack channels

Make sure you join our Slack channels, they are:

- #growth-and-integrations
- #growth-and-integrations-internal
- #growth-and-integrations-ide
- #growth-and-integrations-github

You might want to create a [custom sidebar group](https://slack.com/help/articles/360043207674-Organize-your-sidebar-with-custom-sections) for these channels.
