# Growth and Integrations team

The growth and integrations team owns the initial user journey, growth-oriented projects, our code host and third-party integrations (including our IDE and browser extensions), and Sourcegraph extensions.

Our mission is to bring the value of Sourcegraph to all developers, everywhere they work with code, and to bring the value of other developer tools into Sourcegraph.

Note: It is expected that this team will split into two teams in FY23. As such, this handbook entry separates some content into Growth and Integrations sections.

## Growth vision

_Visitors to Sourcegraph clearly see the value of the product and are compelled to integrate it into their workflow and share it with friends and colleagues. _

This vision is necessarily broad because the growth-oriented goal for the team is the generation of Product Qualified Leads. These PQLs will generally be generated from users who find value in the product and integrate Sourcegraph into their daily routines. As such, this team will also impact the following objectives:

- Improve the retention of all users
- Increase the frequency of users from monthly active to daily active
- Expand usage in existing accounts

## Integrations vision

The power of Sourcegraph is available everywhere that developers read or write code.

- Build a healthy ecosystem of Sourcegraph extensions, built by developers everywhere, who want to bring the power of existing developer tools they love into our platform.
- Build new paths to get value from Sourcegraph on other websites and IDEs.
- All of Sourcegraph's most powerful features are easily available on most any code host while using any browser thanks to native integrations and browser extensions.

## Responsibilities and focus

### Growth-oriented responsibilities

In pursuit of goals related to growth, the team will own or contribute to the following:

- Researching how users become activated, sign-up, and generate PQLs
- Guiding and shaping the initial user journey of:
  - visitors to sourcegraph.com
  - authenticated users of Self-hosted installations
  - TBD: authenticated users to the cloud product
    - Cloud is working on this, but solutions here probably need to be influenced by user journeys developed for the self-hosted product and vice-versa
- Creation and optimization of in-product flows that result in:
  - Cloud sign-ups
  - Self-hosted installs
  - Distribution for product features that factor heavily in user activation, retention, and lead generation
- Coordination with Marketing on projects such as:
  - updates to the homepage
  - collaboration on campaigns that drive traffic to the product
- Experimental growth hacks that will result in increased traffic, sign-ups, and/or PQLs
  - [API Docs]()
  - TBD

## Integration oriented responsibilities

- Sourcegraph extensions
  - Providing a Sourcegraph extension API that enables developers to bring data from their favorite developer tools into their Sourcegraph workflow.
  - Build and maintain useful Sourcegraph extensions (Sourcegraph-maintained extensions; video demos).
  - Documentation and tutorials that enable third-party developers to create actively useful extensions.
  - Building and maintaining the extensions registry, discovery paths, and extensions developer toolsets, to create an ecosystem around Sourcegraph extensions.
- Code host integrations
  - Add native support for Sourcegraph in code hosts (for example: GitLab native integration) when possible, so all users of a Sourcegraph instance can get features like code intelligence on their code host without individual setup.
- Browser extensions
  - Develop and maintain browser extensions that surface code intelligence and other Sourcegraph features on code hosts (for example: Github).
- IDE and other third-party code view integrations
  - Develop and maintain IDE integrations that bring Sourcegraph functionality right to your IDE
  - Explore and develop features for other popular code-view websites like https://pkg.go.dev/ and messaging platforms like Slack
