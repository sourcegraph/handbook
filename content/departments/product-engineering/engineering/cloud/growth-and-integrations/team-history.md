# Growth and Integrations team history

- In late 2021, the Growth and Integrations team merged with the growth team and was renamed Growth and Integrations
- In early 2021, the Growth and Integrations team was formed as an offshoot of the "web team" (which became the 2021 Developer Insights org) because the product direction, support and maintenance, validation, and future promises of Sourcegraph's browser extensions, native code host integrations, and Sourcegraph extensions required and deserved the resources of its own team.
- In December 2020, Sourcegraph released a Safari Extension to support Safari users with our browser extension, in addition to Chrome and Firefox.
- In November 2019, Sourcegraph partnered with GitLab to create a native integration.
- In June 2019, Sourcegraph created a BitBucket native integration so you don't need to install the browser extension to get the value of Sourcegraph on your BitBucket code host.
- In October 2018, Sourcegraph released the extensions API so that others could build on top of Sourcegraph, and so that Sourcegraph could integrate with your other tools.
- In March 2016, Sourcegraph released its first browser extension so that you can take the value of Sourcegraph to your code host for code reviews.
