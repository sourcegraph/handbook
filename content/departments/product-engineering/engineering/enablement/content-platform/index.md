### Requests

Requests to the content platform team can be made through a Slack workflow:

1. In the #content-platform channel in Slack, click the + icon, then “Content Platform Request”

- ![Content platform request in slack](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/content-platform-request.png)

2. This will prompt you to fill out a form with relevant details.
3. Completed forms will be sent to the content platform product manager, who will [triage](#triaging-incoming-requests) and update you with more information.

## Principles

We inherit Sourcegraph's [engineering principles and practices](../../process/principles-and-practices.md) and [Enablement principles and practices](../index.md#principles-and-practices).

## Processes

### Triaging Incoming Requests

The Content Platform Product Manager triages and prioritizes requests on a daily basis. They will:

1. Verify all necessary information is in the request
1. Determine urgency and priority against other work
1. Set expectations with stakeholder/requester
1. Create a Github issue (may automate this, TBD)
1. If applicable, assign to a developer. Otherwise put into the team [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/227/views/5?layout=board&filterQuery=label%3A%22%F0%9F%8F%97+Handbook+website%22) according to priority determined in step 2.

### Tracking Work

- Tool: [Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards)
- [Content platform project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/227/views/1)
  - Project structure:
  - Primary view is site agnostic and prioritized regularly, so you can just pull from the top of the queue when you have availability.
  - Other views are created for us and stakeholders to dive into the details of different sites or projects. These are subject to change regularly as projects and priorities change.

### Planning

We plan using a Kanban workflow in a [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/227/views/5?layout=board&filterQuery=label%3A%22%F0%9F%8F%97+Handbook+website%22). We do not work in iterations or sprints.

#### Weekly Planning Meeting

- _Overview:_ Weekly call with all the teammates to discuss the work in progress and review upcoming priorities. Opportunity to surface dependencies on each other and other sources.
- _Goal:_ connect as a team, ensure we are all clear on status of inflight work and next priorities
- _When:_ Mondays at 21:00 UTC.

### Retrospectives

- _Overview:_ We conduct a bi-weekly [retrospective](../../../../../company-info-and-process/communication/retrospectives.md) to celebrate wins and share feedback.
- _Goal:_ To ensure we improve as a team to become more efficient and effective.
- _When:_ Every second Thursday at 21:00 UTC.
