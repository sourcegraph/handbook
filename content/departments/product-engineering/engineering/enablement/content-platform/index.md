# Content Platform Team

The Content Platform team (part of the [Enablement](../index.md) org) creates, manages, and optimizes the content platforms that enable the success of Sourcegraph’s business objectives.

## Members

{{generator:product_team.content_platform}}

## Our Strategy

[Mission & Vision](../../../../../strategy-goals/strategy/enablement/content-platform/index.md)

## Responsibilities

The current existing content platforms include:

- [Marketing site](https://about.sourcegraph.com)
- [Blog](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/)
- [Learn site](https://learn.sourcegraph.com)
- [Handbook](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com)
- [Docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com)

## Contact

- #content-platform and @content-platform-team on Slack

### Requests

The content platform team helps with updates or changes to the various [sites we are responsible for](#responsibilities). Note that if you're comfortable making changes to one of these sites, you don't have to put in a request for the Content Platform Team. We are happy to serve as a review on your PR, but no need to put in a request unless you need us to complete the work for you. Requests to the content platform team can be made through a Slack workflow:

1. In the #content-platform channel in Slack, click the + icon, then “Content Platform Request”

- ![Content platform request in Slack](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/content-platform-request.png)

2. This will prompt you to fill out a form with relevant details.
3. Completed forms will be sent to the content platform product manager, who will [triage](#triaging-incoming-requests) and update you with more information.
   - **Note:** You'll see a condensed version of your request appear in the #content-platform channel instead of the full text you entered. Your full request will be sent directly to the PM via Slackbot, and they will follow up with questions as needed.

#### Service level agreements (SLAs)

- **Initial response:** all requests will be (triaged)[#triaging-incoming-requests] within one business day.
  - **Urgent requests:** If your request is urgent, flag it in the #content-platform channel or contact the CPT [Product Manager](#members) directly so they can respond as soon as possible. Urgent requests are issues impacting customers' ability to interact with our sites, issues blocking an essential part of a current marketing campaign, or potentially other requests defined on a case-by-case basis.
- **Resolution:**
  - **Non-urgent requests** will be resolved by a due date agreed upon by the CPT and the requestor as part of triage.
  - **Urgent** requests will be worked until the issue is resolved or no longer in an urgent state.

## Principles

We inherit Sourcegraph's [engineering principles and practices](../../process/principles-and-practices.md) and [Enablement principles and practices](../index.md#principles-and-practices).

## Processes

### Triaging Incoming Requests

The Content Platform Product Manager triages and prioritizes requests on a daily basis. They will:

1. Verify all necessary information is in the request
1. Determine urgency and priority against other work
1. Set expectations with stakeholder/requester
1. Create a Github issue (may automate this, TBD) and link the issue in the request thread in the #content-platform channel. You can see an example [here](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C02PSJF0QLU/p1647386134658749).
1. If applicable, assign to a developer. Otherwise put into the team [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/227/views/5?layout=board&filterQuery=label%3A%22%F0%9F%8F%97+Handbook+website%22) according to priority determined in step 2.

### Creating Issues

- Anyone can [create an issue in the repos](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository) we work in:
  - [About](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/issues/new)
    - [Blog](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/issues/new?labels=about-blog)
    - [Legal Docs](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/issues/new?labels=legal)
  - [Learn](https://github.com/sourcegraph/learn/issues/new/choose)
  - [Handbook](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/issues/new/choose)
  - Docs:
    - [Docs](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?labels=docs) for content level
    - [Docsite](https://github.com/sourcegraph/docsite/issues/new) for application level
  - Note: After issues are created, they must be added to the [Content Platform Work project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/227/views/1) to be prioritized
- Anyone can request help from the content platform team according to [this process](#requests)
  - Issues are then [triaged](#triaging-incoming-requests) and added to the proper repo in Github (and to the [Content Platform Work project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/227/views/1))
- Anyone can [create an issue directly in the project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-project-board-note)

### Prioritizing Issues

- Issues are prioritized as they come in by the content platform [product manager](../../../product/roles), with input from the rest of the team and stakeholders
- Priorities are reviewed in the [weekly team sync](#weekly-planning-meeting) to prepare for the upcoming week

### Planning

### Retrospectives

- _Overview:_ We conduct a bi-weekly [retrospective](../../../../../company-info-and-process/communication/retrospectives.md) to celebrate wins and share feedback.
- _Goal:_ To ensure we improve as a team to become more efficient and effective.
- _When:_ Every second Thursday at 14:00 UTC.

### Engaging with Other Teams

  - CPT Product Manager is responsible for keeping Github up to date.
  - Github issue contains a link to the Asana card, and Asana card contains a link to Github issue.
