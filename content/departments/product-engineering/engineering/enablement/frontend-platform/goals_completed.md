- [**FY2022**](#fy2022)

## FY2022

- [Design refresh](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/introducing-sourcegraphs-new-ui/) gives Sourcegraph a more modern look and feel and a better user experience by adding refined search results design, renewing focus on code, improving layouts, unifying headers and navigation, and promoting extensibility.
- [Wildcard Component Library](https://storybook.sgdev.org/?path=/story/wildcard-alert--alerts) provides a base for growth, helps maintain consistency, enables faster FE development, and pays off technical debt.
- [UI performance improvements](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/24869) enhance both actual and perceived page rendering performance.

## FY2021

1. Progress on design debt throughout the web app where the web team owns the design: repo page areas and panels, navigation and headers, general theming, and the blob page (file viewer).
