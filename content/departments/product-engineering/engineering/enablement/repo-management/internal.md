This page contains information that is mostly interesting to members of the Repo Management team.

## Rhythm of the Team

We believe in building a strong team that is welcoming, supportive, and a joy to be part of. We are intentional about building relationships within the team. Here are some ways we do that:

1. Social Hours: a heavily asynchronous team and company does not mean we never talk face to face. We set aside time on a set cadence to get to know each other better. We make time to talk freely about anxieties and challenges we're dealing with so that we can better support each other. 
2. Pair Programming: we love to build together and collaborate on hard problems. Our team solves complex problems and working with others is often the best way to deliver. Engineers on Repo Management self organize pair programming sessions on whatever cadence they desire.
3. Team Travel: nothing can replace meeting each other in person. We do this by using our generous [team travel budget](../../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel#travel-budget-philosophy) to connect as a team every 6 months and our other travel budgets to meet each other as part of other trips. Where should we go next?

## Mechanisms

The following are mechanisms we use to stay in sync. We favor asynchoronous mechanisms whenever possible to respect the working hours of teammates.

1. [Meeting] Bi-weekly Planning and Retro: Every two weeks we plan our upcoming work in our [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/209/views/1).
2. [Meeting] Bi-weekly Sync: We meet to discuss what everyone is working on, high priority issues that may have come through, blockers, and in-flight support.
3. [Async] Monthly Status Update: Every month the EM sends a status update with all of the highlights, challenges, and news currently impacting the team. This drives alignment with leadership and celebrates our wins.
4. [Async] Standup Update: Every morning, the geekbot Slack bot prompts a standup update. Every team member answers it (during their morning) and it automatically posts to the team Slack channel.
