# Educational Resources Library

The Education Resources Library is a collection of resources, books, courses and videos that is curated by [Engineering Education](../../../../../strategy-goals/strategy/enablement/engineering-education/index.md) at Sourcegraph and contributors.

The goal is to provide resources for learning and development in line with Sourcegraph company value of continuous growth.

> NOTE: We're building this library iteratively and it's a living resource. New items will be added.
