Happy new year, and welcome to another iteration of the [Developer Experience newsletter](./newsletter.md)!

To have your updates highlighted here, please tag your PR or issue with the `dx-announce` label! If you have questions or feedback, feel free to reach out in #dev-experience or in our [discussions](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/discussions/categories/developer-experience) as well.

### Backward-compatible database migrations are now enforced

Backward-compatible database migrations are now enforced in the CI pipeline for `sourcegraph/sourcegraph` - see the PR to re-enable the check at [#28872](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/28872). This PR contains some initial documentation on writing backwards-compatible migrations, but it is still a work in progress.

**What is a backwards compatible migration?:** A migration is backwards-compatible with a particular Sourcegraph version if those changes can be applied to a version without ill-effect.

**What has already changed? (TL;DR)**: We've removed our use of golang-migrate that ran database migrations on startup of the frontend service and added a `migrator` service that runs database migrations separately from and prior to instance upgrades. This puts us well on our way to removing the entire class of frequent "dirty database" bugs that plagues many site-administrators on every upgrade.

**What else is changing?:** We will soon be enforcing that the unit tests of the _previous minor release_ continue to pass with the newest database schema. This gives high confidence that any changes to the database will not negatively affect a running instance (behind at most one minor version). This allow site-administrators to upgrade an instance without requiring downtime to run the migrations.

Of course, this check will come with escape hatches in the event of flake or test failures that are locked in the past. We're currently fleshing out the documentation on the subject, so keep an eye out for updates!

For the full announcement or to leave comments, check out [the Slack discussion](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C0EPTDE9L/p1641329708282700)!

### Continuous `main` pipeline failures will now result in a branch lock

In response to a variety of CI incidents (including [INC-21](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/25482) at the end of September) we have introduced automated branch locks via a tool called [`buildchecker`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/dev/buildchecker). When `buildchecker` detects a series of CI failures, it will now automatically restrict push access to `main` to authors of recent failed builds and the DevX team until it sees a passed build, at which point it will unlock the branch. A notification will be posted in Slack to #buildkite-main as well mentioning the relevant teammates.

It is the responsibility of authors of recently failed builds to investigate what might have gone wrong, seek help if needed, and help get the pipeline back green. We hope this will prevent long periods of time where many commits to `main` go untested due to failing jobs. To learn more, check out the [branch lock playbook](../../process/incidents/playbooks/ci.md#buildchecker-has-locked-the-main-branch)

We've also made significant investments towards improving and streamlining the pipeline for better stability and observability - most recently, [a large number of E2E/QA tests were dropped](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/28995) - which will hopefully help with minimizing locks triggered by test and infrastructure flakes.

TODO also mention agent state improvements

### Observability

The previous raw Grafana configuration used to add template variables to dashboards has been replaced with [`Container::Variables`](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/docs/monitoring/monitoring?ContainerVariable) that abstracts away a lot of the behind-the-scenes dashboard config and potential gotchas to make it easier to define template variables on dashboards! Dashboard template variables are used to filter individual panels down by substituting variables in panel queries. Learn more in the [`ContainerVariable` API docs](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/docs/monitoring/monitoring?ContainerVariable).

![template variables](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23356519/148470790-4397f274-68c7-45ab-8f9a-9057d162b1ab.png)

### Local development

The local development docs homepage has been revamped! Check it out at [docs.sourcegraph.com/dev](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev). The [quickstart docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/setup/quickstart) has also been overhauled with a streamlined setup experience featuring `sg setup`, which has been greatly improved!

TODO `sg db ...` https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/29382

### Internal libraries

Actors are now propagated across _all_ internal requests when using the `httpcli` library, and the various approaches for propagating actors across services has been standardized with the new [`actor.HTTPMiddleware`](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@9233e2cd9b96bbbbbfb4be2e72543cb41ad9920c/-/blob/internal/actor/http.go?L94:6#tab=references). This makes it easier to enforce permissions across services. For more details, see [#28117](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/28117).

[`dbconn.Global` has been removed](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/28251)! This is a huge step towards [bringing better database mocking to the entire codebase](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/26113) (check out the [code insights dashboard tracking relevant migrations](https://k8s.sgdev.org/insights/dashboards/ZGFzaGJvYXJkOnsiSWRUeXBlIjoiY3VzdG9tIiwiQXJnIjo3MjY0OTB9)!)

![migration from global database mocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23356519/148499207-4862bdd8-2be6-4e73-9d47-2cd91f2c208c.png)

### Miscellaneous

[Tracking issues](../../process/tracking_issues.md) now support a new marker, `<!-- OPTIONAL LABEL: my-label -->`, that allows you to add labels on a tracking issue that do not need to be present on child issues for them to be considered part of this tracking issue. This is useful for making tracking issues easier to find without adding labels to every single issue within the tracking issue. For more details, see [#28665](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/28665).

Buildkite pipeline steps should now explicitly declare `queue: standard` to avoid experimental or temporary agents. For more details, see [infrastructure#2939](https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/pull/2939).

## Nov 23, 2021

Hello everyone, and welcome to another iteration of the Developer Experience newsletter!

To have your updates highlighted here, please tag your PR or issue with the `dx-announce` label! If you have questions or feedback, feel free to reach out in #dev-experience or in our [discussions](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/discussions/categories/developer-experience) as well.

### Onboarding

Significant progress has been made with sg setup, a new command that is slated to replace all the manual fenangling that must be done today to set up a Sourcegraph development environment. See a sneak peak of the upcoming iteration of the tool [here](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C01N83PS4TU/p1637576910255900)!

### Continuous integration

The Dev Experience team is proposing a "build sheriff" rotation in [RFC 515](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHOOgvWmBB5c4aS_wWPogNCAWT6_tww8tceSy6nzFy8/edit), with the goal of distributing knowledge and responsibilities around our CI infrastructure to all of engineering through regular rotations of "build sheriffs".

You may have noticed a daily update in #dev-experience providing an overview of how CI has behaved that day - this will be helping us track our progress towards a flake-free pipeline! If you need more details, a [dashboard is now available in Grafana Cloud](https://sourcegraph.grafana.net/d/iBBWbxFnk/ci?orgId=1) that features an overview of recently failed builds, steps, and potentially relevant logs. You can use this to see if lots of builds are failing on similar steps, which steps are the most problematic, and whether the issues are potentially related. A link can also be found in the Slack summaries. Let us know what you think on [#26118](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/26118)!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23356519/143134471-85e5cea1-a1a2-44cd-96ff-36f06b7fe125.png)

This dashboard is powered by build logs that are now parsed from Buildkite output and uploaded to Loki, a log database available for query in Grafana Cloud using [LogQL](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/). [Try it out here](https://sourcegraph.grafana.net/goto/LZur5Hpnz?orgId=1)! This can be especially useful when seeing if a build issue is a common recurrence.

We are also trialing a number of additional annotations for build failures that should serve to help surface actionable errors more easily, and are working towards exporting an API for it that will enable more checks to easily add digestible output to builds. Let us know in #dev-experience if you have any ideas for how this could be improved!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23356519/143134415-bc30233b-3d2e-4eb9-a3e6-99add60e839d.png)

### Observability

A proposed revamp of how Honey events are created has been proposed in [#27964](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/27964), furthering work on turning internal/observation into the go-to package for all application observability needs.

[Distributed tracing is now available on worker jobs](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/24008), enabling Jaeger traces to be collected for worker job processing. This is currently only enabled for precise-code-intel-worker in Cloud, and enabling this for other workers is in the works.

[RFC 501 REVIEW: Runtime error monitoring](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d18e_YFJsw5cgDId8Iz1MT8A_GsHZTOGHMuem1JMzuM/edit) implementation is also progressing, which will allow errors to be more easily surfaced in Sentry to complement alerting.

### Code health

Work on reducing usages of globals has continued with [improvements to how site configuration is accessed](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/27453) that allows site configuration clients to be injected into places that require it. This makes site configuration easier to mock out and test without replacing a global variable in mocks.

On a similar note, tests have been undergoing [incremental updates](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/27401) to leverage the more ergonomic and self-contained database mocks - a [brief guide is available](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/languages/testing_go_code#testing-with-a-database) if you know an area of the codebase that could use a similar update!

## Oct 8, 2021

Hello everyone! This is the first iteration of the Developer Experience newsletter. It is a compilation of announcements related to development experience at Sourcegraph.

To be mentioned here in the next iteration, please tag your PR or issue with dx-announce!

### A team has been created

The Developer Experience team has been created in mid September! Our first goal is to improve the CI experience.

### Buildkite incident post-mortem

Between Sep 21th and Sep 24th, our main branch builds were failing. Due to the difficulties we were having to reliably make it pass, we escalated it to an incident. To prevent new failures from piling up on the already broken branch, we made a decision to lock the main branch, which is a pretty unusual event.

You can find the detailed report in[Postmortem REVIEW: INC-21 Builds failing on main](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QlosBcYayKqSeMpVuj-TXrFyxmFsiUyZZ_AM5nUz9OU/edit#), which is now in a reviewable state and open to feedback and any inputs.

We'd like to thank dearly all of those who helped to fix this: [Patrick Dubroy](mailto:patrick@sourcegraph.com), Robert Lin, Eric Fritz, Valery Bugakov, TomÃ¡s Senart, [Thorsten Ball](mailto:thorsten@sourcegraph.com), [Dax McDonald](mailto:dax@sourcegraph.com), Geoffrey Gilmore, [Erik Seliger](mailto:erik@sourcegraph.com), [Dave Try](mailto:dave@sourcegraph.com)and JH. With the actions we've proposed in the postmortem, we don't expect such an event to happen in the future.

### Pipeline improvements

The CI is what enables us to feel confident when delivering our changes to our users, and is one of the key components enabling Sourcegraph to deliver quality software.

Previously, it was really hard to find time to improve the CI because it was competing with infrastructure work in terms of prioritization, making it a frustrating but rational choice. With the recent team reorganization, making that hard choice is not a problem anymore as this component is now owned by the DX team.

Following up on the above incidents, it became absolutely clear that the CI is a big contender in the list of pains faced by everyone. The good news is that it's a pretty actionable one!

Let's start with some numbers:

- August average build time on the main branch: 19m57, on PR 20m24s
- September average build time on the main branch: 27m47s, on PRs 22m32 (1)
- October average build time on the main branch: 17m48s, on PRs 9m34

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23356519/143134230-11641386-4588-4680-82c2-d85b576dc0ce.png)

- Pull requests now run a smaller set of checks on average, and it is easier to add additional PR checks of your own that run over subsets of code that you care about within the pipeline generator.
  See the [Introductory documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/continuous_integration) to help you get started with hacking on the pipeline generator
- Puppeteer [tests](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/25027)[are now](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/25027)[run in parallel multiple smaller steps](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/25027), netting almost a 50% improvement :fire:
- (1) spiked because that's when the executor pipeline was introduced.

**What's next?**

Observability is crucial to being able to know when and on what to act. This led to the creation of [RFC 496 REVIEW: Continuous integration observability](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fknr3NQGmwbKCfnF3Bcr-tYzV-TeuAGq-_Tm2-z_09M/edit#bookmark=id.7ia1mplkc80k) which is now in a reviewable state for everyone.

More speed improvements on the builds are being worked on, stay tuned!

### sg is officially entering our daily workflows

What if we had a tool that would be the entry point to interact with our development environment? That's the idea behind sg! Thorsten Ball has been driving this, with contributions from many other engineers. After a few months in a beta state, it's now becoming an integral part of our workflow.

[sg](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/dev/sg) is now the default way to run the Sourcegraph development environment locally.

- After half a year of working on sg, the PR to remove what we once knew as `dev/start.sh` and `enterprise/dev/start.sh` has [been merged](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/25505). Adios, 993 lines of shell script!
- The docs have also been updated: the [Getting Started guide](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/getting-started) now uses sg.

But wait, there's more! A new group of commands has been added, the "ci" commands.

- sg ci preview: You can now preview which steps your branch is going to run on the CI with the sg ci preview command. See something that shouldn't be running in there? [Open a PR on the pipeline generator](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@main/-/tree/enterprise/dev/ci) !
- sg ci status: No more clicking around to find the current build in Buildkite!
- sg ci build: will trigger a manual build, useful if working from a sourcegraph fork.

And additional goodies: the sg teammate time and handbook commands that will tell you what is the current time of that person that lives very far from you, without having to leave your terminal.

**What's next?**

This is just the beginning. Work on [sg setup](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/24900) has begun. The idea is that we can reduce the Getting Started guide from 8 pages down to "install sg and run sg setup".

### Grafana cloud is now available to all!

Just sign up via GSuite SSO on [https://sourcegraph.grafana.net](https://sourcegraph.grafana.net/). This Grafana instance currently has logs for Sourcegraph Cloud, available for search with [LogQL](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/) via Loki. It has support for querying inferred fields from log messages, filtering for substring matches, and more. [Try it out!](https://sourcegraph.grafana.net/explore?orgId=1&left=%5B%22now-1h%22,%22now%22,%22grafanacloud-sourcegraph-logs%22,%7B%22expr%22:%22%7Bapp%3D%5C%22sourcegraph-frontend%5C%22%7D%20%7C%20logfmt%20%7C%20lvl%20%3D%20%5C%22eror%5C%22%20%7C%3D%20%5C%22migration%5C%22%22%7D%5D)

Metrics and parity with /-/debug/grafana is on the roadmap - follow [#25407](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/25407) for updates on that!

**Shoutouts to teammates that improved our dev experience in September** [**Robert Lin, Valery Bugakov, Thorsten Ball, JH, Camden Cheek, Erik Seliger, Coury Clark and Quinn Slack**](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+label%3Adx) **.**
