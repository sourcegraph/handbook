# IC5 profile - Code Intelligence Platform

See also [internal profile](TODO)

## Business need

Code Intelligence is a core pillar of Sourcegraph's product offering, powering both heuristic and compiler accurate code navigation. The area has a standing need for an IC5 profile to own the technical direction and scaling of the data platform that powers Sourcegraph's cross-repo navigation experience. As such, this engineer is expected to carry out and have the following skills and responsibilities:

- Evaluate and devise the platform technical roadmap to ensure:
  - **Product stability**: Sourcegraph is able to both process and serve code intelligence data efficiently at scale.
  - **Product opportunities**: Sourcegraph is able to offer best-in-class precise code navigation and capitalize on both the data produced and the underlying technology to enable and solve new customer use cases.
  - **Product scale**: Prototypes and solutions to solve the next order of magnitude scale blockers are consistently evaluated.
- Deep systems design, database and algorithmic skills
  - **Distributed systems**: Design and lead development of distributed systems
  - **Algorithmic foundations**: Strong familiarity with properties of tree and graph structures
  - **Depth of knowledge**: Ability to effectively analyze, communicate and work with technological approaches and communicate the trade-off at multiple levels of the software stack: operating systems, containers, virtualization, network communication, database internals, etc.
  - **Database expert**: Deep database design, debugging and optimization skills.
- Acting as a multiplier at the team and org level
  - **Promote and champion** new architectural concepts or codebase idioms at the org level.
  - **Intersection**: Proactively produces approaches or concrete solutions that lie at the intersection of depth of knowledge and multi-team impact.
  - **Mentorship**: Conducts specific 1:1 mentorship both within the team and outside in key expert areas such as algorithmic and database engineering.
