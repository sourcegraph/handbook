# GCP Access Process:

## Standard Access: For permanent access to resources, projects or assets

- Resources in scope for this procedure: GCP Organization Level permissions, Managed Instance and Sourcegraph Cloud
- Clone sourcegraph/infrastructure repo into a new branch
- Under folder gcp/org find the appropriate terraform file:
  - Files are organized by permission level
    - Organization permission
      - Used when granting access across all resources in all projects
    - Folder permissions
      - Used to grant access to all projects and resources in a particular folder, such as engineering projects or managed instances
    - Project permissions
      - Used for granular permissions granted on per project basis
- Modify the terraform in the relevant file
  - If the role you are trying to gain access to already has a resource block, add yourself to it
  - If it doesnt, create a new resource block and follow the naming convention in the file
    - Resource name: projectname_rolename
- Run terraform init and then terraform plan to review changes
  - If terraform plan is changing more than what is expected, reach out to security team to review the unexpected changes
  - If terraform plan output is expected, create a PR
    - Tag security for review
- Once approved, run terraform apply
