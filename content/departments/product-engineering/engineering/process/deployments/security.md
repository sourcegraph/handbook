# Security information about our instances

## HTTPs configuration

All Sourcegraph instances are exposed to the public via Cloudflare, using full SSL/TLS encryption, this includes encryption and trust between the origin servers and Cloudflare.
External clients are presented with a certificate automatically managed and generated by Cloudflare.

To enable full SSL/TLS encryption:

- Access the Cloudflare dashboard. (check 1Password for credentials)
- Select the appropriate zone.
- Ensure the Cloudflare zone has "SSL/TLS" set to "Full" in `SSL/TLS -> Overview`.
- Ensure the external domain used for the instance has `proxied` enabled. This can be verified in [infrastructure/dns](https://github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/blob/main/dns) by searching for the required Terraform `cloudflare_record` resource and ensuring its `proxied` attribute is set to `true`.
- [Configure the origin server to present a trusted certificate](#origin-configuration).

## Origin configuration

Cloudflare full encryption mode requires origin servers to provider a generated "Origin Certificate" in order to trust the origin server and encrypt all traffic.

_If you dont have a certificate, check [generating an Origin Certificate](#generating-an-origin-certificate) before moving to the next steps._

### Attaching an Origin Certificate to Kubernetes

Kubernetes services are exposed through an `Ingress` resource, which has to specify its certificate following the instructions provided in [Configure TLS/SSL](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/kubernetes/configure#configure-tls-ssl)

### Generating an Origin Certificate

Origin Certificates can be generated from the Cloudflare dashboard using the following steps:

- Access the Cloudflare dashboard. (check 1Password for credentials)
- Select the appropriate zone.
- Access `SSL/TLS -> Origin Server` and click "Generate Certificate".
- Use the following options
  - Let Cloudflare generate a private key and CSR
  - List the hostnames: `*.foo.bar`,`foo.bar`
  - Certificate Validity: 15 years
- Click Next
- Save the Origin Certificate and Private key to 1Password, **you wont be able to get the private key again**.

## Cloudflare

### WAF

The Cloudflare WAF is enabled via terraform. To turn it on or off, update `cloudflare_zone_settings_override` in `[sourcegraph/sgdev].tf`, and set `waf='[on/off]'`, then run `terraform apply`.

To configure the Cloudflare WAF, add or update WAF rules in `[sourcegraph/sgdev]-waf.tf`. For documentation on what configuration options exist, check [the terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs). Note that the configuration options may be restricted by plan, as documented in the [Cloudflare API documentation](https://api.cloudflare.com/).

The Cloudflare WAF must be turned for any instances containing customer data, including Cloud.

### Rate Limiter

The Cloudflare rate limiter is configured via terraform. To change the behavior of existing rate limiting rules, or create new ones, edit `[sourcegraph/sgdev]-waf.tf`. For documentation on what configuration options exist, check [the terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cloudflare/cloudflare/latest/docs). Note that the configuration options may be restricted by plan, as documented in the [Cloudflare API documentation](https://api.cloudflare.com/), as well as the [rate limiting configuration guide](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001635128-Configuring-Cloudflare-Rate-Limiting). Also note that we are restricted to 10 rate limiting rules with our current plan, so be purposeful about using these.
