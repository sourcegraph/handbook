# Code Security tiger team

The purpose of the Code Security [tiger team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_team) is to iterate quickly with customers over new user flows addressing the [Fixing security vulnerabilities use case](../../../../../strategy-goals/strategy/use-cases/fixing-security-vulnerabilities.md) over FY23Q2.

## Workflow

### Sync

We sync weekly on Wednesday. See our [sync doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r7wiK8F8AQvvnv5YMRAeqNLDS4WkDSvGvbGQVsX1xis/edit#)

### Customer discovery

We use lookback for customer discovery sessions and [airtable](https://airtable.com/appNsjegbsi2XumCg/tblam1hdUFUSFLzyS/viwTBDtytBqAxoZ40?blocks=hide) for collecting insihgts.

## Reading list

If you are interested in the space but don't know where to start, here's a few items to put on your reading list:

- The [log4j vulnerability, and how Sourcegraph helped](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/log4j-log4shell-0-day/)
- Blogs from well known companies in the application security space provide good perspectives. For example (non-exhaustive list!), [Snyk's](https://snyk.io/blog/), [Veracode's](https://www.veracode.com/blog), [Sonatype's](https://blog.sonatype.com/).
- Software supply chain is a key area of interest:
