# Product/Engineering/Customer Support Department Meeting

Our team is rapidly growing and we want to provide a forum to:

- share department updates
- drive alignment around our initiatives and strategy
- celebrate wins and build engagement
- provide everyone an opportunity to ask questions

Audience

- All of Product/Engineering/Custoemr Support (& anyone else who wants to join!)

Cadence

- Once a quarter (meeting will be recorded for those who can't attend live)

Format & content

- A week prior to the meeting, we will send out a presentation including updates from Product, Engineering, and Customer Support As a follow up of watching the videos, there will be a Q&A Google doc to add your questions and upvote questions forleadership to answer live at the meeting.

  - The video update may contain: OKR progress updates, org updates, new processes, guest speakers from other departments, etc.

- 1 hr live Q&A session

  - Live Q&A is meant to foster conversation and discussion.

  - Please watch content in advance of the meeting and submit your questions via the Q&A doc before the call to maximize value of time spent synchronously.
  
  - Reminder that your questions can be about anything related to Sourcegraph or product/engineering/customer support (it doesnâ€™t have to be specifically about the content provided).

  - You can start adding your questions and/or comments to the Q&A doc a week before the live Q&A session so people can view and upvote.

  - Preface your question with your full name (first and last name) or "anonymous" if you prefer to remain unknown.

  - If someone submitted a question you want to upvote add "+1" next to it so we can prioritize questions accordingly.

  - During the Q&A please add additional information and comments to the Q&A doc vs. Zoom chat so people not attending live can also benefit.

  - You can continue to add questions to the end of the queue in the Q&A doc as the live Q&A is taking place.

  - If we don't get through all the questions during the live Q&A, they will get answered async in the Q&A doc.
