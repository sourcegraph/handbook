# Onboarding

Welcome to the Design Team!

Having gone though [the Process St onboarding](https://app.process.st/reports/) and [the Product onboarding](../../onboarding/index.md), it's time for the Design onboarding!

Your perspective as both a new user of Sourcegraph and a new teammate is very valuable to us. Please keep notes on any issues you encounter as you are onboarding and learning the product. Weâ€™ll use those notes to improve the product and process.

# Manager checklist

- Complete the [product team manager checklist](../../onboarding/index.md#manager-checklist)
- Add the designer to these team meetings:
  - Design sync meeting (both meetings!)
  - Design retro meeting (first Wednesday of the month)
  - Add the designer to the relevant meetings for their team (if not handled by email groups)
- Notify people ops to include the new designer on the following GitHub groups:
  - @sourcegraph/design
- Notify people ops to include the new designer on the following Slack groups:
  - @design-team
  - @product-team
  - Their product team
- In their 1-1 doc introduce the designer to a few Figma files that are relevant to their team


## Designer checklist

- Join the design-related Slack channels:
  - design
  - product-design-internal
  - accessibility
  - analytics-review
  - wildcard-components-library-wcl
  - hallway-testing
- Add yourself as a designer to the handbook pages of the teams you're working with. You can also add those teams to your Slack profile description, for ex. 'Product Designer (Code Insights)'
- Get familiar with the products that we use as inspirations for reference in the developer tools industry:
  - code hosts: [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab] (https://gitlab.com/)
  - code editors: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (and other IDEs like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/))
  - similar products: [grepp.app](https://grep.app/) and [cs.opensource.google](https://cs.opensource.google)
- Read the [Product Design team handbook](../index.md), especially:
  - [User research](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/product-engineering/product/design/research/)
  - [Analytics and product design](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/product-engineering/product/design/metrics/)
  - [Wildcard design system](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/product-engineering/product/design/wildcard_design_system/)
- Set up Figma

## Creating your first Figma project

- Consider using the [Project Template](https://www.figma.com/file/JzufQnpTQtreyfnA3qpmfz/Project-Template?node-id=246%3A11) (read more in [Documents and Templates](../documents_templates/index.md))
  - This project doesn't fit all working styles or projects. If it doesn't work for you, consider trying to standardize on the following conventions:
    - Name pages consistently, use emojis to help indicate purpose
    - Use  a cover page and cover component to help with readibly
    - Use an About section to help others know what the file/page/section does
