## Using Figma 

- Figma is the main design tool used by the design team. 
- We use Figma for designing, prototyping, and for handoff. 
- We also use another tool called FigJam for whiteboarding and brainstorming. 
- Even if you’re not a designer, you may need to interact with Figma or FigJam files for various reasons. 
- Figma has great documentation for anything you might need. 

Finding Figma and FigJam files:
- You’ll probably get to Figma files from links in GitHub or Slack. 
- If you want to revisit a file that you’ve looked at recently, the Figma homepage (figma.com) shows your recently viewed files in chronological order. 
- Within the Sourcegraph organization, there are also projects. We use projects to identify different product areas like Code Insights and Extensibility. 
- There’s also a search bar on the Figma home page. 

Figma terminology: 
- Figma files are organized into pages 
- Each page has “frames,” which can be any size
