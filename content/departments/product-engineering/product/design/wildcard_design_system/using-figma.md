## Using Figma

- Figma is the main design tool used by the design team.
- We use Figma for designing, prototyping, and for handoff.
- We also use another tool called FigJam for whiteboarding and brainstorming.
- Even if you’re not a designer, you may need to interact with Figma or FigJam files for various reasons.
- Figma has great [documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us) for anything you might need.
- There's an example file that you can peruse: [Figma for Sourcegraphers](https://www.figma.com/file/JH7GVilasQ11c9DdjpZUIF/Figma-for-Sourcegraphers-Part-1?node-id=1%3A144)

### Finding Figma and FigJam files:

- You’ll probably get to Figma files from links in GitHub or Slack.
- If you want to revisit a file that you’ve looked at recently, the Figma homepage (figma.com) shows your recently viewed files in chronological order.
- Within the Sourcegraph organization, there are also projects. We use projects to identify different product areas like Code Insights and Extensibility.
- There’s also a search bar on the Figma home page.

### Figma terminology:

- Figma files are organized into pages
- Each page has “frames,” which can be any size
