## What I do at Sourcegraph

I'm the PM (Product Manager) for [Distribution](../../engineering/distribution/index.md) & [Security](../../engineering/cloud/security/index.md)

## About me!

I live in north Dorset in a pretty little town called [Shaftesbury](https://www.shaftesburytourism.co.uk/) [🗺️🔗](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shaftesbury/@51.0075245,-2.2003362,15z) with my wife, her 2 kids (5y,8y) and our identical twin boys (15m as of May '21).

We also have a 3 legged dog - Fender (10y). (He doesn't let either his age or his missing leg stop him sprinting everywhere and jumping in cow troughs when out on a walk.)

## How I like to work

I'm an early bird. So once the kids are fed I get to work around 7:30-8am. But I'm in the UK, so most of my lovely colleagues aren't awake till my afternoon/evening. So my mornings are a mixture of bouts of focused solo work and reclaiming some time for myself.

I tend to have meetings from about 3/4pm till about 8pm, though I try and break for dinner and bathtime with my family (bathtime 🛀 is chaos).

## Feedback

I love feedback, but it can be so damanging done badly. I think it has to be timely, and reasonably direct, but most importantly it has to be with empathy. IF you can't appreciate (and **show** them you understand) why someone did something, don't give them feedback.

Other than that, I like to give and recieve in a way that allows for discussion. Questions, exploration, shared understanding, and mutual empthay.

## Communicating

I like time to think, and writing helps me process (so the async Sourcegraph culture is 💯 up my street), but I'm equally happy chatting things over.

I'm always a little sceptical of the value of big meetings. It's hard to give everyone a voice, and without a strong lead and even stronger agenda it's hard to make them really valuable. But they can work.

I love 1:1. It's where I'm most happy. Both people have to be focused, and it's all about achieving a shared understanding. It's also the best way to actually get to know someone, and doing so is utterly invaluable for working with people.

## Career history

I started as a network and security engineer - managing firewalls, web filtering, wireless, WAN and LAN connectivity and security, virtual networking, load balancing... etc. I realised I didn't have the patience to fixate on any one subject for too long... and that's how I arrived at management 😆

I did that for a while before being asked if I wanted to help lead building products like that. I did. Very much so 👍 That was for a company that built an on-prem (nearly always physical!) firewall and web filtering appliance.

Then I moved to London 🇬🇧 (I'm from Southampton) and became the 1 and only PM for a SaaS property management product... it was a great experience, and I hired and trained up someone (who's now a great friend) to be a second PM.

Then I hopped over to Snyk, where I spent 2 and a bit years working on everything from APIs to onboarding to user acquisition to partnerships (all as a PM).

And now Sourcegraph 🎉🎉🎉
