# Product

The product team at Sourcegraph consists of [product management](process/index.md), [product design](design/index.md), and [technical writing](technical_writing/index.md).

The Product team strives to make the following true:

- The team is working on the most important things to execute on [our strategy](../../../strategy-goals/strategy/index.md), and that this is communicated well to teammates and everyone outside of sourcegraph.
- Each teammate has the customer and product context needed (about customer problems, likely future priorities, possible solutions, etc.) to perform their work effectively.

## Contact

You can reach us at the #product channel or @product-team on Slack. If you have ideas you want to pass on to the product team, check out the [surfacing product feedback](process/surfacing_product_feedback.md) page.

## Product team initiatives

Occasionally the product team takes on special initiatives that are not strictly tied to product delivery. Those are tracked [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/product-engineering-tracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Product+Initiative%22).

To create a new one, go to the [new issue screen](https://github.com/sourcegraph/product-engineering-tracker/issues/new/choose) for the [product-engineering-tracker repo](https://github.com/sourcegraph/product-engineering-tracker) and choose `Product Initiative`; this will ensure it gets the correct label to be included in the search above.
