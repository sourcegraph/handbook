# Product Feature Compatibility

This page is intended as a reference of features by code host compatibility; each item will link you to our documentation.
You may also be interested in seeing our [feature maturity](feature_maturity.md) matrix.

Note that this page only lists features that have an incompatibility with a code host; if a feature is not listed here it can be assumed to be compatible with every code host.
