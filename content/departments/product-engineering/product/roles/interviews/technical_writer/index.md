# Sr. Product Education Engineer interview process

_Total interview time: 4.5 hours + ~1 hour project_

1. [30 min] **[Initial screen](../initial_screen.md)**: Meet with our recruiting team to chat about Sourcegraph and what you are looking for in your next role.
1. [30 min] **[Hiring manager screen](../hm_intro_call.md)**: We discuss your background & get to know you.
1. [Async] **[Portfolio Submission/Review](pd-ed-eng-opt-port-assign.md) (Hiring Manager)**: This is where you get to show off all the great work you've done. Of course, we also understand not everyone can take examples of their work with them when they leave a company or share examples from their current role. If this is your situation, you can use the optional async writing assignment (see below).
   - [1 hr (Async)] **Optional - Portfolio Assignment** - If you choose to complete the async assignment, we'll send it to you after you've completed the other steps above. Don't worry though, it's straightforward, consisting of two parts: Research and Technical Writing. The whole thing shouldn't take you more than 1 hour, two at the most. Once submitted, we'll review and get back to you regarding next steps.
1. [1 hr] **[Resume deep dive](../../../../../talent/process/types_of_interviews.md#resume-deep-dive)**: We go through your background in great detail with the hiring manager.

1. [1 hr(Async)] **[Assignment Technical Writing/Planning](pd-ed-eng-planning-writing-assign.md)** For this assignment we'll give you a situation and supporting information to build a project plan. We won't be looking for you to build any technical content though. Instead, we want to understand how you think about planning a content project, how you deal with ambiguity, and how you identify resources necessary to make a project a success. We expect this assignment to take an hour, but ask that you don't spend more than 2. You will have one week to accommodate your schedule, and if you need additional time, please let us know.
1. [1 hr] **"Onsite" interview**

   - [30 min] **[Assignment Review](pd-ed-eng-planning-writing-assign.md**) (2 members of Product Manager/Support Team/CE) During this session, weâ€™ll go over your project plan and ask questions about your process. Again, our goal here is not to ensure you got everything right, but that you have exposure to these concepts, and can talk about how you would organize this project.
   - [30 min] **[Values interview](../../../../../../company-info-and-process/values/index.md)** with someone from another Sourcegraph team (Marketing, Customer Support, BizOps)

1. [30 min] **Final interview** with [Christina Forney](../../../../../../team/index.md#christina-forney), VP Product
1. We make you a job offer!

We want to ensure Sourcegraph is an environment that suits your working style and empowers you to do your best work, so we are eager to answer any questions that you have about us at any point in the interview process.
