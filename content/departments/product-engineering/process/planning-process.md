# Product/Engineering planning process

This page documents the process we follow to produce and update artifacts like our [annual strategy](planning-communication.md#annual-strategy), [quarterly department OKRs](planning-communication.md#quarterly-department-okrs), and [roadmap](planning-communication.md#roadmap)

## Annual strategy process

We will better define this process when we get closer (sometime in Q4) to producing the FY24 strategy.

## Quarterly KRs process

One of our goals in FY23 Q1 is to come up with a plan for how we want this process to work for Q2 (and then update the documentation here).

## Roadmap process

FY23 Q1 is the first quarter where we are trying to capture the roadmap in GitHub. We will learn a lot throughout the quarter as we attempt to do this and will update this documentation based on our learnings.

We expect to not need a lot of formal process here, because if we are effectively using this roadmap as a source of truth, it will organically get updated on a regular basis as part of normal team operations.

## Quarterly department retrospective

Near the end of each quarter, the product/engineering VPs and Directors will get together for a retrospective. The purpose of this retrospective is to create a shared safe space for celebrating wins, learning, and improvement.

- Before the retrospective we will
  - Solicit feedback from the broader product/engineering team
  - Asyncronously write down thoughts on topics we may want to discuss during the retrospective. Prompts may include but aren't limited to:
    - What went well (wins) for yourself and for your team?
    - Did we accomplish what we said we were going to accomplish?
    - What didnâ€™t go well (struggles and challenges) for yourself and for your team?
    - What did you and/or your team learn?
    - What should we start/stop/continue?
- During the retrospective we will vote on what topics we want to discuss and then discuss those topics.
- After the retrospective, we will share notes and action items in a public channel for transparency.
