# Collaborating on the new user experience

The new user experience (NUE) crosses the bounds of several teams' ownership areas. For example, a visitor to the product may view the home page, search several times, learn about Code Insights and then sign up for the product. Throughout this journey, they should be informed as to the major functionality and use cases of Sourcegraph as well as how to use each feature.

No one team or organization can effectively own this entire experience, so careful collaboration will be required to avoid duplication of efforts and help our users find success with Sourcegraph.

## Cloud responsibilities

### Growth

The Growth team will own the initial journeys of both new unauthenticated and authenticated users take to discover key functionality and use cases. Typically these journeys will typically provide an introduction to major product differentiators and features that factor heavily in user activation and retention. This includes the unauthenticated homepage, product tour and/or quick start flows, sign-up flows, and the post sign-up flow.

From time to time, the Growth team will need to alter these user journeys to accommodate advances in product functionality.

The scope of Growth's efforts should not extend the specifics of how to use individual product features.

### Cloud SaaS

The Cloud team will own user journeys related to the onboarding of teams. This includes flows related to team creation, user invites, and administration.

## Code Graph responsibilities

Search, Batch Changes, Code Insights, and Code Intelligence will own user education for their specific product areas. They will collaborate with other code graph teams to promote feature discovery in places like search results, repository pages, and other areas of the site where integration opportunities exist.
