# Submitting a bug report

As a Sourcegraph teammate, you have the ability to report bugs in the product when you come across them. You may wonder if there is a specific way to do this and this is why this doc exists. This is a step-by-step guide on what is the correct way to submit a bug report.

The steps below assume that you have encountered a fault and an error that makes the product behave unexpectedly.

## Steps

1.  Head to the issues GitHub page [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues).
2.  Click on `New Issue` (the green button on the right hand side of the page).
3.  A template named `Bug Report` should be the second option available to you. Go ahead and click on `Get Started`.
4.  Give your report a `Title`. There's no standard way of doing this although the general rule-of-thumb is to give a brief summary of the problem
5.  Please be as detailed as possible in your description of the problem by;
    1.         Sharing what Sourcegraph version you are currently experiencing the problem on.
    2.  Highlighting any additional platform information(if you're hosting your own instance).
    3.  Providing steps that could help someone else reproduce the issue that you've encountered. In here, please feel free to get creative(add screenshots,gifs or blocks of code to describe errors etc).
    4.  Lastly, sharing what the actual behavior vs the expected is.
6.  Finally, please go ahead and add the `bug` label on the right hand side of the page by clicking on the small gear on the `Labels` section and typing in bug. Also, if you know the team that owns the part of the product that you've experienced the bug in, please feel free to add the team name as well.
7.  All done! Go ahead and submit!

##A quick note
Please note that if you are submitting a bug report on behalf of a customer, keep the report as general as possible, purposely withholding any sensitive information that can directly(or indirectly)point to a customer.
