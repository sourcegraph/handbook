## **Communications/Asking a Question**

The Data and Analytics team will strive to be Handbook first. Have a question? Look for the answer in our Handbook paged. Don’t see what you are looking for? Ask a question in one of our Slack channels.

- #discuss-analytics: for anything related to analytics, not just the Data & Analytics team (e.g the impact on a shift from HubSpot to Marketo, sharing a deliverable that has cross-functional impact, or a question related to data you don’t know where to ask).
- #discuss-data-engineering: for anything related to data engineering, not just the Data Engineering team
- #announce-operations: for announcements and general updates

We will answer questions and triage requests that come through these channels. See some of our [FAQs here](faq.md).

- #team-data-eng: for Data Engineering internal team communication
