We are experienced data analysts and data engineers who own and manage the data platform and BI tools.

## **Communications/Asking a Question**

The Data and Analytics team will strive to be Handbook first. Have a question? Look for the answer in our Handbook paged. Don’t see what you are looking for? Ask a question in one of our Slack channels.

- #data-analytics-internal for internal Data & Analytics communication
- #analytics for anything related to analytics; not just the Data & Analytics team (e.g the impact on a shift from HubSpot to Marketo, sharing a deliverable that has cross-functional impact, or a question related to data you don’t know where to ask).
- #analytics-review for help with self-service and WIP data projects (questions about the data, requests for peer review). Although we do expect to be involved in this quite a bit, it’s not just meant to get feedback from Data & Analytics. We will also be using this channel to have our work peer reviewed and collaborate with other folks from different parts of the business! Anybody comfortable enough with data can be a peer reviewer or answer questions
- #data-eng for Data Engineering communication

There is an analyst on support each week that will be answering questions and triaging requests that come through these channels.

# **Sprint Planning**

We currently work in two week sprints that run from Monday to the following Friday. Requests that come in mid-sprint will be placed in the backlog and triaged at the next sprint planning meeting. If something is urgent, please let us know and we can prioritize as needed.

For larger data, reporting, or analysis requests, the first action will be to plan a scoping exercise for the analyst or engineer in order to size the level of effort and determine where it sits in the overall priorities.

General outline of our planning process:

- Thursday before a new sprint: synchronous sprint planning. Plan out the sprint 2-4 weeks out, and review the upcoming sprint
- First Monday of the sprint: send out a message to #analytics with the wins from the last sprint and the plan for the current sprint (and a link to 2-4 weeks out if anyone wants to look)
- First Friday of sprint: post updates to the issues in the sprint with a status and do an async review of where we’re at, if we need to push anything out or pull anything in
- Repeat

Planning Principles:

- OKR-driven
- Mix of quick wins and long-term, proactive projects
- Only choose projects where we have a clear picture of what the result looks like and the impact it will make; if these aren’t clear, we should block time to further scope them
