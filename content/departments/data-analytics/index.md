## **Communications/Asking a Question**

The Data and Analytics team will strive to be Handbook first. Have a question? Look for the answer in our Handbook paged. Don’t see what you are looking for? Ask a question in one of our Slack channels.

- #team-data-analytics for internal Data & Analytics communication
- #ask-analytics for anything related to analytics; not just the Data & Analytics team (e.g the impact on a shift from HubSpot to Marketo, sharing a deliverable that has cross-functional impact, or a question related to data you don’t know where to ask).
- #team-data-eng for Data Engineering communication
- #announce-operations for announcements and general updates

There is an analyst on support each week that will be answering questions and triaging requests that come through these channels.
