# **Support Model**

Supporting a **Self-Service** framework for BI and Analytics is imperative to being a data driven organization.

This framework consists of three principles:

1. Give the right people the right set of tools and capabilities
2. Create a collaborative environment
3. Create a process to govern how this collaboration leads to continuous improvement of our analytics capabilities

## **Personas**

In our Self-Service framework, we need to accommodate multiple personas because not all users will want to self-serve the same way.

## **Viewers**

- Viewers are interested in standardized reporting on standardized metrics. They are interested to see how metrics change over time and may want to drill into specific datasets for those metrics. Viewers will request new standard metrics or new filters on current standard reports. They will also request new views and reports. Viewers may want to create their own views or dashboards for their own personal use.
- Examples of use cases of a viewer
  _ I want to view standard/trusted reporting on multiple topics
  _ I want to filter results with a set of standard filters
  _ I have a set of metrics that I am measured against and want to track progress of those metrics
  _ I want to automate a set of metrics that I report out on regularly

## **Creators**

- Creators are interested in all the components of a Viewer, but will also want to create their own views/reports. Creators will also want to perform ad-hoc analysis. They are interested in both standard metrics and new/undefined metrics. They may be able to write queries directly against a data warehouse. And creators will use our standard tools, but may use other tools that are not part of the Data and Analytics tech stack.
- Examples of use cases of a creator
  _ I want to create and share views/reports on multiple topics across multiple standard tools
  _ I want to perform ad hoc analysis
  _ I want to query the DWH to understand and analyze data quickly
  _ I want to automate analysis
  
  ## **Enablement**
  
  We provide enablement in multiple ways dependent on the subject, the team or individual, or the tool.
