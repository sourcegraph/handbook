# **Stakeholder Management**

The analysts will be aligned to the business initiatives and cross-functional stakeholders will know who their point of contact is. This allows the analyst to build relationships and embed in a specific project to become a subject matter expert.

The data engineering team will be considered a shared service that will prioritize the requests across all business units and will adhere to an agreed upon ratio of prioritized tasks and self-directed tasks like addressing tech debt, optimizations, and platform health and administration.

## **Project Intake**

The Data and Analytics team will accept project/enhancement requests through [GitHub issues in the Sourcegraph analytics repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/analytics/issues).

Examples of requests that require an issue:

- New dashboard
- Exploratory analysis
- Implementation of new business metrics (e.g. “Can we start tracking page views of our case studies?”)

When creating GitHub issues, please include as much relevant information as possible. Please use the relevant issue template in the repository and fill out the requested information. If no template matches, create a blank issue and include as many details around your request as possible.

This information is useful:

- The problem: Describe the problem or question you have.
- End state: What is the end state of the project? What decisions will be made? Be as specific as possible (i.e. if the end state is a graph, draw out the graph in a tool or paper)
- The why: What will this request be used for? How does it support our goals?
- Timeline: What’s the timeline of the project? Is it urgent? When does this need to be delivered, and how will it be followed up on in the future?
- People: Who is involved, and what are the expectations of each person? Who will be responsible for driving the project forward? Does each person have the necessary bandwidth for driving the project forward? Does each person have the necessary bandwidth to uphold the expectations asked of them?
- Frequency: Is this a one time ask or something that is needed ongoing? If ongoing, what is the cadence (daily, weekly, monthly, etc…)

A Data and Analytics team member will triage and assign issues to the relevant team member. For time-sensitive or urgent requests, please tag the issue with the urgent label and follow up in the #discuss-analytics channel.
