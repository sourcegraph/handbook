# Dev Ed Council

The Developer Education Council (DEC) will provide advisory support to the Developer Education team as they build out the Sourcegraph Learn platform and create resources for developers and partnerships with educational groups.

## Outcomes

Advisement from the DEC will serve as important input to influence the development of the Learn platform and strategy of resource creation.

## Expectations

Pending a successful first session, members of the DEC will commit to future sessions once per quarter.
