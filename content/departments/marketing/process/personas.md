# Personas

## What are "personas"?

A persona is a set of people who share common problems and other traits. Instead of writing a blog post for a single specific person, or building a feature for a single specific person, we target broad sets of people ("personas"). For general information about personas, see "[Personas for Product Management](https://svpg.com/personas-for-product-management/)".

## Why are personas important?

It is crucial that as a customer-centric growing startup, we always keep our target audiences in mind, across all activities in the company. No matter the role, each of us are designing for, building for, huddling around, and ineracting with our personas and as such, it is important that we are all aligned in our understanding of the key charactericits, pain points, and motivations of the people we are trying our best to delight.
