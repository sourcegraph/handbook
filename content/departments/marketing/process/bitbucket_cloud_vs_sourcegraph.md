# Bitbucket Cloud vs. Sourcegraph

[Bitbucket Cloud](https://github.com) is a code host and review tool. Sourcegraph and Bitbucket Cloud integrate well together.

- [Bitbucket Cloud integration with Sourcegraph](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration/bitbucket_cloud) (Sourcegraph documentation)

> Sourcegraph also supports [Bitbucket Server](bitbucket_server_vs_sourcegraph.md), Atlassian's self-hosted code host.

## Code search

Bitbucket Cloud offers limited [code search](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/search-873876782.html), which is acceptable for smaller teams using Bitbucket Cloud with simple/infrequent code search needs. The main pain points we hear are lack of support for literal/regexp queries, and that the UI is not optimized for searching across multiple repositories. For medium and large organizations, Sourcegraph is a better alternative to Bitbucket Cloud's built-in code search.
