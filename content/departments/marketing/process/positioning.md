# Sourcegraph platform positioning

## What is Sourcegraph?

**1-line description:** Sourcegraph is a code AI platform.

**Boilerplate:** Sourcegraph is a code AI platform: “software that builds software”. Our code graph powers Cody, the most powerful and accurate code AI for writing, fixing, and maintaining code, and Code Search, helping devs explore their entire codebase and make large-scale migrations and security fixes. Our customers include 4 of the top 10 banks, 4/5 FAANG companies, government organizations, Uber, Plaid, and many other companies building the software that pushes the world forward.

## What about universal code search?

Previously, we positioned Sourcegraph as universal code search. While code search will always be essential to what we are as a company and as a product, we've evolved to become a 2-product company built on top of a core platform.

## How can we use the platform positioning?

Whether you’re pitching a candidate on why they should join Sourcegraph, talking to an engineering leader at a target account, or just looking to answer the question “what is Sourcegraph” next time your family asks, here are some best practices:

- Think about the audience
- Tie it to something the audience (or their business) cares about
- Use an analogy to help them understand
- Tell a story to show how we evolved from a code search tool, to a code intelligence platform, to a code AI platform
