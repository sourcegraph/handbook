## What about universal code search? 

Previously, we positioned Sourcegraph as universal code search. While code search will always be essential to what we are as a company and as a product, it doesn't reflect the evolution of Sourcegraph as a company and suite of products that solve 5 compelling use cases. 

## How can we use the platform positioning? 
Whether you’re pitching a candidate on why they should join Sourcegraph, talking to an engineering leader at a target account, or just looking to answer the question “what is Sourcegraph” next time your family asks, here are some best practices:
- Think about the audience
- Tie it to something the audience (or their business) cares about
- Use an analogy to help them understand
- Tell a story to show how we evolved from a code search tool to a code intelligence platform
- Connect it to our five use cases
