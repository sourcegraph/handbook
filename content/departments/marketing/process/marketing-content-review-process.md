# Marketing content review process

**All marketing content we create should:**

- Be free of typos and grammatical errors
- Be technically precise, accurate, and easy to understand
- Resonate with devs

To ensure all content meets this bar, we’ll follow a review process for important external comms and content, including:

- Blog posts
- Email campaigns
- Landing pages/major web updates
- Videos
- Case studies

## Tips for drafting content

Having a review process does not mean that we should wait to get feedback or share drafts until the content is “final.” Throughout the content creation process:

- Collaboration and getting feedback early is encouraged. Ask questions, run ideas past teammates, etc.
- Share drafts with teammates, your manager, etc., and ask for 20% feedback before finalizing the content:
  - 20% feedback: Feedback on the strategy, approach, and overall direction.
  - 80% feedback: Feedback on the specific content (words, design, etc.).
- Save drafts in public folders so other teammates can contribute.

## Review process

1. **Self-review:** Before sharing content with others for a formal review, review your content and make sure it meets our high bar. Here are some tips:
   1. **Typos and grammatical errors**
      1. Use Grammarly
      2. Give yourself time between writing content and editing content
      3. Read your content out loud
   2. **Technical precision and accuracy + dev-first writing**
      1. Check the [handbook](../../../company-info-and-process/communication/content_guidelines/terminology_guidelines.md) and [docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/?_ga=2.190972906.1747313014.1663792166-1869712147.1659118261) to understand how Engineering and Product describe our product
      2. Research how other companies or devs write about a given subject
      3. Spend time reading content by devs/for devs
      4. Get feedback from Engineering and Product (#product, #ask-a-dev, etc.)
      5. Ask your PM/EM counterpart questions to help you understand the product
2. **Marketing peer review:** Once you feel good about your content, share it with another member of the marketing team for a peer review.
3. **EM/PM review:** Share a draft with your Engineering or Product counterpart. If you aren’t working directly with an EM/PM, then post in #marketing-eng-content-review. To make this as productive as possible:
   1. Give the reviewer at least 72 hours to review (sometimes this won’t be feasible)
   2. Flag specific questions and areas of confusion/concern.
   3. For headlines and other key sections, provide a few alternatives to give the EM/PM something to respond to.
   4. Be clear about who the audience is.

Expectations for the EM/PM:

- Ensure the content is technically precise and accurate
- Help ensure the content will resonate with devs

4. **Final review:** Once Marketing and Eng/Product feel the content meets our high bar, share with a marketing leader (Amie) for final review. By this stage, the content should be:
   1. Be free of typos and grammatical errors
   2. Be technically precise and accurate
   3. Resonate with devs
5. **Exec review (optional):** Exec review should be included for:
   1. Highly visible content: email campaigns, homepage updates
   2. Controversial content
   3. Major launch content

Work with your manager if you aren’t sure whether or not exec review is required.
