# Communications

## Team vision & principles

The global communications team supports the entire organization and influences the way we’re perceived as a brand and company. We do that by raising awareness about Sourcegraph’s product, growth, and mission in the press, through speaking, events sponsorship and awards, across social media, as well as facilitating communication across the company for our teammates.

The Comms team is made up of the following functions & leads:

- Global comms & public relations: Amie Rotherham
- Internal comms: Madison Clark
- Social media: Bachi Degli-Innocenti
- Field marketing & demand gen campaigns: Olivia Simpson

## _Internal comms:_

Projects & responsibilites:

- **Company Announcements** - Share important information with the entire company and get support on how to communicate that content.
  - If you’d like to share a message in #announcements, please send a request to #internal-comms and tag Madison Clark.
- **Bi-weekly All Company Meeting** - This live session gives the company a chance to align on shared goals, celebrate recent wins, and hear from members of the team in ways that we can’t always achieve asynchronously.
  - If you have something you’d like to share at an upcoming company meeting, send a message to Madison Clark in #internal-comms.
- **Cross-Functional Internal Comms Support** - Need to communicate something to your team, or share information across multiple departments at Sourcegraph? Work with the internal comms team to refine your messaging and build a comms plan to share the information in an effective way. We have templates to make this process smooth (linked below).
- **Exec-AMA** - Our team also facilitates two-way communication between Sourcegraph teammates and leadership. We monitor #exec-ama and work with leadership to get teammates’ questions answered, and also host synchronous AMA sessions during the off weeks between company meetings. Submit your questions in #exec-ama or directly to a member of our comms team and we’ll coordinate a discussion about that topic.
- **Quarterly and annual kickoff events** - At the beginning of every quarter, we bring the whole company together via a special company meeting focused on progress from the previous quarter and goals for the one ahead. Work with our team to add content to this meeting and share ideas on fun ways to kickoff a new quarter together.
- [**The Git Down newsletter**](https://us8.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=df2a46502c53acf0b7771317f&id=e8e7daeb55) - This monthly newsletter complements other internal comms channels and gives our team a way to share longer-form content with the team. If you want to include something in a future issue, sent a message to #internal-comms.
