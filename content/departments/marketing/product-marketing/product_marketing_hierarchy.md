# Product marketing hierarchy

A product hierarchy is a way of organizing our products and features. As we evolve from offering a single product to multiple products and features, having a clear product hierarchy helps marketing prioritize our efforts, make naming decisions, ensure consistent style guidelines, etc.

Only L1 products that are Generally Available (GA) will have dedicated product landing pages and inclusion on the about site homepage.

Our product hierarchy will be updated as we launch new products and features. Here is the current hierarchy as of 2021-05-09:
