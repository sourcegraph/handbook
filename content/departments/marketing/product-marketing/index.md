## Working with other teams

| **Team**                | **Where PMM can add value**                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **How we collaborate**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Product/Engineering** | Product roadmap planning and prioritization, bringing new products to market, pricing and packaging, naming, conducting primary and secondary research, product copy, collaborating on content (blog posts, webinars, etc.)            | PMM will be better able to support feature/product launches and influence the product roadmap with early involvement.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Sales/CE**            | Messaging and positioning, use cases and value drivers, buyer personas, creating external collateral (pitch decks, one sheeters, case studies), product training, competitive intelligence, synthesizing and sharing customer feedback | PMM primarily focuses on “one:many” communication, whereas Sales/CE primarily focus on “one:one” communication. There may be times that PMM is brought in to support a strategic customer or prospect, but the team is not big enough to support every deal. |
| **Marketing**           | Messaging and positioning, buyer personas, content development and review, subject matter expertise, marketing campaigns and programs                                                                                                  | We function as a cohesive marketing team and loop cross-marketing stakeholders in early to collaborate.                                                                                                                                                      |
