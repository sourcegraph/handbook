- How you approach problems
- Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated
- Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help
- What you find enjoyable at work
- What kind of work do you find easiest to do when (for example, some folks write best at night or can focus more easily in the afternoon)
- How do you feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for you to see and respond to during active hours
- How folks can best show up for us when we seem off (give space, ask if work is the right place for us to be today, etc)
- Things you are aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work
- Marketing areas of knowledge
