# Hound

[Hound](https://github.com/etsy/hound) was created inside Etsy by [Kelly Norton](https://github.com/kellegous) and others and open sourced in 2015. It appears to not be actively maintained anymore, with the most recent commit (as of this document's publishing) being more than 5 months old, and many open PRs unattended to.

Sourcegraph is a good replacement for Hound for almost every organization.

## Pros

- Very simple deployment
- Very simple interface

## Cons

- Apparent unmaintained status
- Poor scalability to many repositories (both performance-wise and UX-wise)
- Limited filtering available for search queries
- No support for code navigation (code intelligence and/or ctags)
