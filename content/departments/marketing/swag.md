# Gifting Guidelines

Sending swag is useful:

- As a thank you gift for attending an event
- To strengthen the bond after a demo
- Customers’ who we’d like to make a personal connection with
- As a welcome gift once a buyer closes a large sale
- To active community members that have contributed actionable, useful feedback on Sourcegraph products
- Someone who has advocated for Sourcegraph’s adoption at their current company
- Those who participated in a Sourcegraph-hosted event as a guest or speaker (virtual chat, panel discussion, podcast, web series guest, and similar)

> Make sure that you comply with our [anti-corruption/anti-bribery policy](../people-talent/people-ops/process/anti-corruption.md) and reach out to #legal slack channel or legal@sourcegraph.com with any questions.
