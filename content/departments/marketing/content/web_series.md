# Web series

<!-- Describe what a web series is and why we do them at Sourcegraph -->

## Dev Tool Time

Dev Tool Time is a bi-weekly web series livestreamed on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sourcegraph) where Sourcegraph engineers interview other devs in the community about their desk set up, favorite dev tools, productivity hacks, and more. Recordings are later available on our [YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7DHo90Boa4&list=PL6zLuuRVa1_iDEP4EicZ8972RgyccCRGF).

This series aims to help new developers learn about existing tools but also update experienced developers who might not know about certain developer tools and workflows. While Sourcegraph may be mentioned, it will not be the main focus. This series is genuinely to inform developers about all the different tools out there and enhance developer awareness about the importance of having the right tools setup to increase coding efficiency.

#### Preparing for your episode

- Episodes range in length from 30 minuntes to an hour
- The show will be live streamed on Twitch using the restreamer.io platform, which offers several options for attendee participation. You can call in via restreamer. The restreamer link will be on your calendar invite 1 week prior to the live stream.
- We’ll start off with you showing a photo of your desk (please be ready to share your screen) so you can talk about what setup has facilitated your work practices and environment. This is just an ice breaker so we’ll keep this segment short to about 5 minute but we’re also flexible if you want to invest more time into this.
  Then we’ll go over to talk about the developer tools you love, diving into your developing processes, etc.
  You can focus on presenting your dev environment and dev tools. Our co-hosts will be forwarding you any questions that come up from the audience.
  The session will be recorded and will remain available on YouTube. We’ll make sure you get a link to the recording of your session which you can share and embed however you like.
