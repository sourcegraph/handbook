## Asset Management

Later in 2021, will be using a tool called [Brandfolder](https://brandfolder.com/home) to store and manage access to our final, approved files and brand assets, with the ability to share folders with external partners and ensure version control for team-wide use. In the meantime, Google Drive will be the shared source for currently-in-production and in-use files plus final assets and brand identity files.

Here is our top-level [Brand folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bV8Fis1ZKszGwMFWbjfRUFBVWeIui0NP?usp=sharing) in the Sourcegraph Team Drive.

Here is our externally-accessible [Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AB4h8L66C8qAUk9PVA) — _Sourcegraph-Brand Design (ext shared)_—for when we need to share or receive files from vendors. After a design is approved in Asana, final files and working files should be uploaded to the appropriate vendor folder in the Shared Drive.

## Naming Convention

(asset name) + (category) + (version) + (file type)
Looks like: Asset-Name-category-version.xxx
Example in practice: Sales-Pitch-Deck-v7.ppt; POC-Kickoff-1sheet-v3.pdf
_Note: Dates, names, descriptions and other important info is stored as metadata and any file notes can be added in Get Info. When we launch Brandfolder some of this will be auto-generated using AI and machine learning._

**Example Categories**
Brochure
Banner
Social (incl. Platform abbreviation and type, such as Header, Preview, Card, Story, etc.; dimensions are captured in metadata of the file): TW=Twitter; IG=Instagram, LI=LinkedIn, GD=Glassdoor, YT=YouTube, DS=Discord, TH=Twitch, RD=Reddit
One-sheets
Business Card
Letterhead
Swag (Include shirt, mug, socks, etc. if designed for a specific item)

### Foldering System

Brand > Assets > Type of Asset > Program or Campaign (if applicable)

File Locations
**Google Drive** - all finished photography in appropriate subfolders; finished videos\* and cutdowns; print and digital design conceptual and finished files; finished audio files. [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bV8Fis1ZKszGwMFWbjfRUFBVWeIui0NP) is our library of assets (for now, Brandfolder coming soon). All videos and photos should be stored in the main Brand folder, organized by content type and main use case. Any assets that have expired usage dates, or are simply outdated due to personnel or messaging changes, should be archived and labelled as such. We should scrub the drive quarterly to ensure freshness of content. Working files will be stored in Drive as well in a separate folder tree labelled Working Files. Backups will be held at 3 offsite locations on external drives.

_Some videos created in collaboration with partners may only be sharable for limited time periods, i.e. weeks, months, or years. Please add notes in the Description section of the file after uploading to the appropriate location in Drive, and set an expiration date for sharing privileges if sharing outside of the team._

Select the file in Drive to open this submenu, then ‘Add a description’

**Brandfolder** - raw photos and finished video projects archive, including SRT (captions) files; edited and approved photos; copies of print-ready and digital final approved designs (one-pagers, flyers, banners, social graphics, etc.); brand assets for sharing with partners and third parties (limited access). Brandfolder is not like the National Archives for our digital media. The content inside that is accessible to internal and external users should always be considered final and approved, but everything (including raw, unedited video footage) should be stored on physical drives for long-term archival storage as well as maintaining a cloud-based backup.

**In-house RAID** - original, unedited raw video footage video backup, including .mx4 and .r3d file formats; hard drive backups of all raw photography and audio files. Hard copy backups of all files located at two locations (since we are fully remote, likely locations include at homes of Producer, Editor and Creative Director).

## Sourcegraph Preferred Vendor Network

The Brand team maintains a list of approved or contracted vendors + agencies. Some of them we work with on an ongoing basis, and some we don’t, but either way we are available for intros, scoping, or estimates. All of these vendors have either been vetted by the Brand team, previously contracted, or are a direct referral from an employee or trusted partner.

If for any reason our team is unable to support individual requests for creative (either directly or indirectly), we will happily facilitate an introduction to a recommended and trusted vendor to ensure that your project is attended to with the utmost care and quality, and stay close to the work throughout to ensure a successful project or program.

### About The Network

Though our permanent full-time team may be smaller, we pull in experts, specialists, and extra help when needed to quickly and dramatically scale the volume and scope of the work we do. We do this by maintaining relationships with the best in the business in various fields, such as video production, storytelling, social media, community, web design, and merch. The vendors from our network flow in and out of our team as needed, and disperse when appropriate, in order to efficiently manage the ebbs and flow of business needs with little to no service disruption.

## Success Metrics

What can we/should we be capturing to identify successes and areas for improvement when we look back on 2021?

**Analytics Status:** Working with Marketing, Sales, and People teams to better understand the most critical metrics to monitor and optimize for, after which we will build an initial set of universal dashboards to test data flow and accuracy. Once established, we will work with the Marketing Ops lead (open role) to set up individual dashboards to track each campaign and generate automatic and one-time reports for read-outs.

**Process Metrics Status:** We use Asana and Harvest tor project management and time tracking. At the end of each quarter, we can prepare an analysis of internal process benchmarks to provide improvement targets.

Examples of process metrics include:

- Job types (Projects per tier per quarter)
- Milestone schedules (% of hitting each milestone)
- Staff utilization (as a %); creative vs administrative time
- On-time delivery rate (final deadline)
- Error rate (should be zero)
- Average rounds of revisions (1–2 is target)
- Rounds of creative (less is better, should decrease over time)
- Speed to market (avg. time to delivery)
- Volume and frequency of rush requests (“P0s”) handled
- AEV (Agency Equivalency Value): Cost saving of in-house vs Agency supported
- Project Volume (total # and total hrs.)
- External Agency Spend
- Volume of requests per team/individual
