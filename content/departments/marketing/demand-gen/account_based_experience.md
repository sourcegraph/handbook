# Account-Based Experience

Account Based Experience (ABX) isn’t just a fancier name for Account Based Marketing (ABM). ABX focuses on using experiential marketing to create connections to brand using personalized marketing strategy fueld by intent data and predictive anaytics.

## Program Goals

Our goal with ABX is to make Sourcegraph valuable and accessible to every developer and company and solve big code problems for the largest enterprises. Our marketing approach is simple. Sourcegraph can help developers find code quickly, better understand code, and automate.

We know we can add value by maintaining a strong partnership between Sales and Marketing to focus on targeted marketing, personalization, and measurable results.

We want to resolve challenges faced by developers everyday:

### Poor experience

- Poor onboarding
- Slow code review
- Unclear ownership
- Tribal knowledge
- Manual processes

### Slow velocity

- Tech debt
- Heavy processes
- Slowed new product output
- Risky releases
- Legacy code

### Security risks

- Days (not hours) to patch
- Unmaintained code
- Ad-hoc incident response
- DevSec friction

## Key Stakeholders
