## What to do if you are waiting for your Sourcegraph computer to arrive

Currently, we are experiencing extensive wait times to receive new laptops due to Apple logistics delays. If you are waiting for your Sourcegraph computer to arrive you can either:

1. Use your personal device as a temporary measure, as long as the minimum security measures can be instituted
1. Request a loaner laptop - this is severly limited based on to location and availablity
1. Rent a laptop from a local provider, #it-tech-ops can pay for this service - this is also limited by location and availability

## Use of personal devices

If you are a temporary contractor, waiting to receive a Sourcegraph computer, or if there has been some damage or circumstance where the machine is unavailable, you may use a personal device as a temporary solution provided that you either set up WS1 and Carbon Black or, at a minimum, set up our [standards](../process/internal-security/computer-standards.md) and have an antivirus installed on the device. Please reached out to the Tech Ops team in the #it-tech ops channel to get an invite to our antivirus software, Carbon Black.

If you do work from your non-company device you would be acknowledging the risks associated with doing so. For example, if anything happens to the device (broken/stolen/etc) it would not be the responsibility of Sourcegraph to replace or fix it. If there were to be a breach and company data was compromised then the computer could be taken over by a forensic team and inspected.

## Requesting a loaner

Tech Ops has a number of previously used computers available to be allocated in the event you need one. Please reached out to the Tech Ops team in the #it-tech ops channel to request a device. As we are a global company not all situations can be accommodated through this process, however, Tech Ops is committed to ensuring you have access to the device you need to do your job and will work with you to find the right solution.

## Damaged computers

If something has happened to your Sourcegraph device please contact #it-tech-ops and we can assist you in fixing your device, getting you a loaner while your device is getting fixed, or helping you send your device to be evaluated and repaired/replaced. All Sourcegraph computers should be purchased with Apple Care or some form of warranty. For repairs under warranty, a teammate can either send it to our partner, ComputerCare, to be fixed or else go to their local Apple store. For repairs not under warranty please contact Â #it-tech-ops to have it sent to ComputerCare to be evaluated and repaired/replaced.

## Used computers

If you have a device that you are having replaced, or you are leaving the company you can either:

1. participate in our [buyback program](../process/buyback.md), where we will transfer ownership to you.
2. return it to Sourcegraph, through ComputerCare, to be repurposed or recycled. To return it to Sourcegraph, please contact #it-tech-ops to open a ticket for you.
