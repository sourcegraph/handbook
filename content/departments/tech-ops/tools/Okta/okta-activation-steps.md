# How to activate Okta

## First: Set up your Okta account and add Okta Verify to your mobile device

On your first day, you will find an email from **Okta** on your personal email account. This email includes a link to your Sourcegraph Okta sign-in page and your username (your Sourcegraph email address). You need this information to set up your account.

6. Tap “Add Account”.
7. Choose the type of account to add - for Okta Verify, choose Organization.
   1. Organization: Add a multifactor authentication (MFA) account for your work, school, or business that uses Okta as an authentication provider.
8. Tap “Scan a QR code” and point your camera at the QR code displayed in the browser on your computer. Note: this can be done using the Okta Verify app on your laptop as well.
9. If prompted, allow push notifications on your device so that you can approve future sign-in notifications without opening the Okta Verify app.
10. If prompted, enable Face ID or Touch ID.
11. Tap Done to complete the account enrollment.

Your new account is now available in the Okta Verify app.

## Second: Make sure your device is enrolled in Jamf

After setting up your Okta password you may need to enroll your Sourcegraph laptop in our endpoint management system, Jamf. If your device was purchased by Sourcegraph, when booting up your machine you will be prompted with a Remote Management screen. This will kick off the Jamf enrollment process and no further action is needed.

**If you have purchased and expensed your Sourcegraph Laptop, you will need to reach out in the [#ask-it-tech-ops](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C01CSS3TC75) Slack channel to get an email invitation to join Jamf.**

## Third: Open the Okta Dashboard

Once signed in to your Okta Account, you will be taken to the Apps Dashboard (shown below). You can access your Sourcegraph Google Workspace Account (to view your Sourcegraph email inbox) and other assigned applications from this page.
