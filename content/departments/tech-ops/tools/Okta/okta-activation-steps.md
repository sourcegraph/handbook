# How to activate Okta

## First: set your Okta account

On your first day, you will find an email from **Okta** on your personal account. This email includes a link to your Sourcegraph’s Okta sign-in page and your username (your Sourcegraph email address). You need this information to set up your account.

6. Tap “Add Accoun”t.
7. Choose the type of account to add. For Okta Verify, choose Organization.
   1. Organization: Add a multifactor authentication (MFA) account for your work, school, or business that uses Okta as an authentication provider.
8. Tap “Scan a QR code” and point your camera at the QR code displayed in the browser on your computer.
9. If prompted, allow push notifications on your device so that you can approve future sign-in notifications without opening the Okta Verify app.
10. If prompted, enable Face ID or Touch ID. Tap Done to complete the account enrollment.

Your new account is now available in the Okta Verify app.

## Second: enroll your laptop to Workspace One

After setting up your Okta password you then need to enroll your Sourcegraph laptop in our endpoint management system, Workspace One. To install WS1 on your device navigate to [getwsone.com](https://getwsone.com) and once that installs you can sign in with your newly created Okta credentials to register your device. More info on this can be found [here](../endpoint-antivirus.md#what-is-workspace-one).

## Third: open the Okta Dashboard

Once signed in to your Okta Account, you will be taken to the Apps Dashboard (shown below). You can access your Sourcegraph Google Workspace Account (to view your Sourcegraph email inbox) and other assigned applications from this page.
