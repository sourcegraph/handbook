# Computer buyback program

Sourcegraph teammates have the opportunity to purchase their previously used device after they have gone through a [device upgrade](../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/spending-company-money.md#laptop-upgrade). The entire buyback process, including a full wipe, should be completed within two weeks of receiving a new device.

Tech Ops will source the current trade-in or fair market value of the device and offer a 50/50 purchase price to keep the device as a personal device (please no haggling). Tech Ops will then work with the teammate to finalize payment and perform a factory reset on the device through our endpoint security software. For legal reasons, resets must be performed by Tech Ops and be full factory reset.

## Steps for processing a purchase:

1. Submit a buyback request form - anywhere in Slack, type **/assist** and press enter, select the Computer Buyback form in the drop down menu
2. Tech Ops will respond in ticket, providing you the cost and next steps
3. Submit payment (via check or Paypal)
4. Sign a document accepting ownership of the device ‘as-is’
5. Schedule a time with Tech Ops to perform the device wipe
