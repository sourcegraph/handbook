# Computer buyback program

Sourcegraph employees have the opportunity to purchase their device after they have gone through a device upgrade, per company upgrade policy timelines.

Tech Ops will source the current trade in or fair market value of the device and offer a 50/50 purchase price to keep the device as a personal device.
Tech Ops will then work with the employee to finalize payment and factory reset the device through our endpoint security software.

The form to submit for device buy back can be reached by employees in [GDrive](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOHJDHYHdmbggRni0NWcg-vn_h0XYc6GrdM4RYlcjxhtirEg/viewform).
