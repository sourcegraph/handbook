# Computer buyback program

Sourcegraph employees have the opportunity to purchase their device after they have gone through a device upgrade, per company upgrade policy timelines or when they leave the company.

Tech Ops will source the current trade-in or fair market value of the device and offer a 50/50 purchase price to keep the device as a personal device.
Tech Ops will then work with the employee to finalize payment and factory reset the device through our endpoint security software. Resets must be performed by Tech Ops and through Workspace One. They will be complete device wipes and resets, with no exceptions.

The form to submit for device buyback can be reached by employees in [GDrive](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOHJDHYHdmbggRni0NWcg-vn_h0XYc6GrdM4RYlcjxhtirEg/viewform).
