# Computer buyback program

Sourcegraph teammates have the opportunity to purchase their previously used device after they have gone through a [device upgrade](../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/spending-company-money.md#laptop-upgrade). The entire buyback process, including a full wipe, should be completed within two weeks of receiving a new device.

Tech Ops will source the fair market value of the device and offer a 50/50 purchase price to keep the device as a personal device (please no haggling). Tech Ops will then work with the teammate to finalize payment and perform a factory reset on the device through our endpoint security software. For legal reasons, resets must be performed by Tech Ops and be full factory reset.

## Steps for processing a purchase:

1. Submit a computer buyback request form - [Tech Ops Requests Jira Portal](https://sourcegraph.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/11/group/16/create/10119)
2. Tech Ops will respond in ticket, providing you the cost and next steps
3. Decide if you would like to proceed with purchase or return the device to Sourcegraph
4. Submit payment (via check or Paypal)
5. Sign a document accepting ownership of the device â€˜as-is, provided by the Tech Ops staff during process
6. Tech Ops will schedule time with you on your last working day to reset the device - this step applies to purchasing and returning
