# Travel Tips

As an all-remote company, we are encouraged to take advantage of working from anywhere. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when on the road.

## Device security

**Before you go**:

- Make sure you check and install any software [updates](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-macos-updates-mchlpx1065/mac) on your laptop before you leave a secure and fast network connection, as sometimes these can take a while
- Increase the [password](../internal-security/passwords.md) complexity on all your devices
- [Change](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-screen-saver-preferences-mchlp1227/mac) your laptop screen lock time from 5 Minutes (Sourcegraph [standards](../internal-security/computer-standards.md)) to 1 or 2 minutes
- Erase anything private/sensitive on your hard drive and save everything to [Google drive](../../tools/drive.md) instead
- Review our [computer requirements](../../tools/computer-setup.md) to make sure standards and [Jamf](../../tools/endpoint-antivirus.md) are in place
- Presenting? Demoing at an event? Contact Tech Ops for a loaner to bring along - avoid using your own laptop for presentations/demos/etc. if there is a possibilty someone else might access it
- Consider using [1Password Travel Mode](https://support.1password.com/travel-mode/) to remove Sourcegraph password vaults from your device when traveling through security checkpoints

**While traveling**:

- Never leave your devices unattended in public
- Use the safe in your hotel room to store your laptop
- If viewing sensitive information in public, use a privacy screen filter on your laptop screen
- Avoid public WiFi networks, and use a VPN if you must connect to one

## Network troubleshooting

Having network connection issues (eg. WiFi not working)?

- Try another location and/or device
- Restart your computer, try connecting again
- If you cannot connect after a restart, please reach out to the Tech Ops team in the #ask-it-tech-ops channel via Slack on your phone or email to techops@sourcegraph.com. Please include as much detail as you can (screenshots, error codes, where you are, how you are connecting, etc.)
