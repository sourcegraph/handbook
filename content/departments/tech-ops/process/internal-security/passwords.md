## Password requirements

Keep in mind that the passwords we choose contribute to the security of our Sourcegraph-managed systems and data. In addition to being users, many of us are also administrators so it is especially important to be thoughtful when selecting a password.

Below is guidance for setting passwords to Sourcegraph-managed accounts, these are strongly recommended and will be enforced at the organizational level when available.

**Do:**

- Make passwords complicated enough to need the use of a password manager (we use [1Password](https://1password.com/))
- Make passwords randomly generated through the use of a password manager (we use [1Password](https://1password.com/))
- Create a new password for every system - the primary goal is password diversity
- Make passwords hard to guess, even by those who know a lot about you
- Use a mix of numbers, letters (upper and lower case), and special characters
- Create a password that is ideally 15 characters or longer
- When creating your own, we recommend using a passphrase or sentence so itâ€™s easier to remember and meet the above requirements! Example: HungryAnteaterAte1400Ants!

**Do not:**

- Use the browser based auto-fill, the 1Password browser extension should be used
- Use a password that is the same or similar to one you use on any other websites
- Use a single word, for example, **password**, or a commonly-used phrase like **Iloveyou** or a string of numbers/letters, such as **abc123**
- Use identifiable information about yourself, such as the names and birthdays of your friends and family, your favorite bands, or phrases you tend to use
- Mix personal and work-related passwords
