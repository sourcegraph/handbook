**Removing Workspace One and Carbon Black from my personal computer**

In order to remove Workspace One and Carbon Black from your personal device, please reach out to the Tech Ops team. The Tech Ops team can initiate what’s called an “Enterprise Only Wipe” which will remove Workspace One and all associated profiles and applications (Carbon Black) from the machine.
