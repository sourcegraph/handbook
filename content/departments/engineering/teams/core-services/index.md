#### Sourcergaph.com Google OIDC

The GCP project that manages our [Google OIDC authentication integration](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient/394401733494-3ekkk0qr3qvg7b3l1imqcgsh3ej710eq.apps.googleusercontent.com?project=sourcegraph-com-ggl-oidc) ("Sign in with Google") for Sourcergraph.com.
