# Managed Services

A big part of the Core Services team is developing and maintaining our managed cloud services infrastructure.
Going forward, new managed services - internal and external - should aim to be deployed using [MSP (Managed Services Platform)](./platform.md).

Guidance for MSP incidents is available in [Managed Services incident response](./incidents.md).
