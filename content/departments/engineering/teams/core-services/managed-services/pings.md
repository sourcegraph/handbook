# Pings service

The Pings service is the service that collects [ping requests](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/pings) from all Sourcegraph instances, and is available at `pings.sourcegraph.com`.

- As of 5.2.0, ping requests are sent to `https://pings.sourcegraph.com/updates` directly.
- For Sourcegraph instances that prior to 5.2.0, all ping requests sent to `https://sourcegraph.com/.api/updates` are being transparently forwarded to `https://pings.sourcegraph.com/updates`.

> NOTE: There is now a generated operations reference for the MSP-based Pings service in [Pings infrastructure](../../../managed-services/pings.md), generated by `sg msp operations` - as the generated docs improve, some content from this page will be migrated away.

## Service images

Source code for Pings service is in [sourcegraph/sourcegraph/cmd/pings](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/cmd/pings). The image gets built the same way as any other Sourcegraph service, i.e. with `insiders`, the standard `main`-branch and `main-dry-run` tags.

All images tags are available in the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcegraph/pings/tags).

## Local development

For local development, please refer to its [README](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/cmd/pings/README.md).

## Operations

> [!NOTE]
> To get access to most resources, you’ll need to [request infrastructure access](#infrastructure-access).
>
> Refer to [Pings infrastructure (go/msp-ops/pings)](../../../managed-services/pings.md) for our new MSP-generated guidance.

### Infrastructure access

Refer to [Pings infrastructure (go/msp-ops/pings)](../../../managed-services/pings.md) for Entitle requests that are needed to get access to Pings service infrastructure:

### Deployment

The Pings service infrastructure is defined in [`sourcegraph/managed-services/services/pings`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/managed-services/tree/main/services/pings) utilizing [Managed Services Platform](./platform.md).

#### Modify deployment manifest

> [!WARNING]
> Due to the early-stage shape of [Managed Services Platform](./platform.md), we have yet to roll out standardized playbook. Please reach out to #team-core-services for modifying the deployment manifest. Instructions in this section are generally assumed with an upfront setup.

To modify the deployment manifest:

1. Update `service.yaml` file
1. In the repository root, run `sg msp generate services/pings/service.yaml prod`
1. Stage changes and make a pull request
1. The Terraform Cloud rolls out changes

#### Use a different image tag

To specify a Docker image tag other than the default, update the `service.yaml`:

```diff
 - id: prod
   ...
   deploy:
     type: manual
+    manual:
+      tag: 218287_2023-05-10_5.0-5bd03cd18e71
```

#### Re-deploy the same manifest

Go to the ["Deploy revision" page](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/deploy/us-central1/pings?project=pings-prod-2f4f73edf1db) of the Cloud Run service and click **DEPLOY** (bottom of the page) without changing any configuration. This will also happen whenever a Terraform change happens to the "cloudrun" stack.

#### Update the service resource allocations

The following section in the [`service.yaml`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/managed-services/blob/main/services/pings/service.yaml#L29-L35) defines the resource allocation for the Cloud Run service instances:

```yaml
environments:
  - id: prod
    instances:
      resources:
        cpu: 1 # Per-instance CPU
        memory: 1Gi # Per-insatnce memory
      scaling:
        maxCount: 3 # Maximum count of instances
        minCount: 1 # Minimum count of instances, setting to 1 can avoid cold start
```

Once updated, follow the [Modify deployment manifest](#modify-deployment-manifest) to apply the changes.

### Observability

> [!NOTE]
> To get access to most resources, you’ll need to [request infrastructure access](#infrastructure-access).

#### Alerting

- [GCP Monitoring Alerting](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerting?project=pings-prod-2f4f73edf1db)

All alerts from all environments currently go to #alerts-pings-sourcegraph-com.

#### Metrics

The deployment's [Cloud Run metrics overview page](https://console.cloud.google.com/run/detail/us-central1/pings/metrics?project=pings-prod-2f4f73edf1db) provides basic observability into the service provided out-of-the-box by Cloud Run, such as instance count and resource utilization.

Pings service also pushes [GCP Custom Metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/builder/eda5de3e-2bd2-41ad-afe2-7c7dfaeeebba?project=pings-prod-2f4f73edf1db) via OpenTelemetry metrics.
