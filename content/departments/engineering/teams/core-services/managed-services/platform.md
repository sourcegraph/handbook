# Sourcegraph Managed Services Platform (MSP)

The Sourcegraph Managed Services Platform (**MSP**) is the standardized tooling and infrastructure for deploying and operating managed Sourcegraph services.
It takes a service specification and generates Terraform manifests and adjacent resources required to operate a service.

All assets are managed in [sourcegraph/managed-services](https://github.com/sourcegraph/managed-services), and the tooling is being developed in [sourcegraph/sourcegraph/dev/sg/msp](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/dev/sg/msp).
