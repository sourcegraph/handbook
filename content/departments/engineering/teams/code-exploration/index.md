- [<span class="badge" style="background: #c2255c; color: white; font-weight: bold">team/code-exploration</span>](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?labels=team/code-exploration) label on GitHub
- @sourcegraph/code-exploration team on GitHub
- code-exploration@sourcegraph.com Google group for mentioning in Google Docs and calendar invites
- [Code Exploration Events](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y181MmU3ZmZmY2UzMWEyZjU1ZDMyOTExYjVkYmMxOTI0OTk1NzI1OWRmYjU3NWMzMmVhYTg0YzNkMTBmNWRiMWZlQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) calendar
  - Teammates should add this calendar (calendar ID `c_52e7fffce31a2f55d32911b5dbc19249957259dfb575c32eaa84c3d10f5db1fe@group.calendar.google.com`) as an additional calendar in the [Roots PTO Slack app](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/time-off/submitting-time-off.md) so that their PTO is visible to their team on the team calendar (and disable adding their manager directly to the calendar invite).
- #code-exploration-internal for team (non-product) related discussion
<!-- - #code-exploration-eng for higher bandwith communication typically amongst the engineering team / PM. This channel is separated out of #code-exploration since this discussion can get quite noisy for the casual observer of #code-exploration. -->
