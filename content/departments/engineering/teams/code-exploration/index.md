## Ownership

The Code Exploration team owns the core Sourcegraph code exploration UI, which includes the following vertical areas:

- Repository routes
  - Revision selector
  - Breadcrumbs
  - Blob view
    - Hover popup
    - Sidebar
      - File tree
      - Symbols sidebar
    - Bottom panel
      - Reference panel
      - History panel
    - Actions toolbar
    - Fuzzy finder
    - Blame view
  - Repository/directory landing pages
  - Diff views
    - Compare page
    - Commit page
  - Contributors page
- [Integrations](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/integration)
  - IDE extensions
  - Browser extensions
  - Native code host integrations

We take responsibility over the following horizontal concerns:

- The navigation experience between pages and general interaction with the browser
- General performance of the webapp (e.g. how we do data fetching)
- General keyboard accessibility of the webapp (global keyboard shortcuts)
- General customizability of the webapp (e.g. theming, shortcuts)

As the largest frontend team, we also recognize our responsibility to be a steward of our web platform and the cross-team Frontend Crew.

## Processes

### Weekly sync

We hold a weekly sync with notes and pre-filled agenda in our [team sync notes doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1teUwDotZy1qgZivPkt7ga62lzhdmNNl5_NGSrdyNl8A/edit).
Ask in #code-exploration if you'd like to make a guest appearance to discuss something!
All meetings are recorded and posted automatically to #code-exploration-internal.

### PTO

Every teammate configures their [Roots PTO Slack app](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/time-off/submitting-time-off.md) to add our team calendar as an additional calendar (and disables adding their manager directly to the calendar invite) so that their PTO is visible to their team.
