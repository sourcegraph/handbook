## FY2021

### FY-21-Q4

1. ✅ Three customers give us qualitative feedback after using our code insights prototypes to guide the initial product strategy.

   - **Outcome:** We have a list of potential features and their likely value that we can use to achieve our initial adoption milestones ([Productboard view](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com/feature-board/2327586-code-insights-next-objective)).

1. ✅ We have decided on and implemented metrics to quantitatively measure the adoption of code insights prototypes (see [RFC 279](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I10tm5CFZvzQYNeV--JacRGLLIUesXQBp6ZO8uhakRs/edit#)).

   - **Outcome:** We have weekly quantitative reports on the use of code insights at each customer. [TODO: add link to looker dashboard once dashboard is made.]

1. ✅ Code insights can scale to large (if not the largest) codebases.

   - **Outcome:** All but the largest customers can use insights prototypes over their entire codebase to answer questions about the state of _all_ of their code, using a timescale DB backend. x
