## Contact

For **questions** and **discussions** about anything related to developer experience, post a message in the [#dev-experience channel](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C01N83PS4TU).

For **urgent requests** or if you're **blocked** on something important, add the `@dev-experience-support` tag in your message.

- The `@dev-experience-support` tag will ping an on-call member of the DevX team.
- Requests tagged with `@dev-experience-support` will get priority support.
- Please use the `@dev-experience-support` tag only for issues that require immediate attention.

You can also interact with us on **GitHub**:

- [team/dev-experience](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/labels/team%2Fdev-experience) label
- To request a code review from us, tag the @sourcegraph/dev-experience team.
- We also monitor and track issues with the [dx](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/labels/dx) label in our [GitHub project](processes.md#dev-experience-project).
- We have a public [GitHub Discussions board](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/discussions/categories/developer-experience). You can also create a discussion directly on our board with the command `sg feedback`

> NOTE: When referring to this team, prefer to use _Dev Experience_ or _DevX_ - only use _developer experience_ or _dx_ when referring to developer experience in general.

## Principles

We inherit Sourcegraph's [engineering principles and practices](../../dev/process/principles-and-practices.md). In addition, the following principles guide the work we do in dev experience. Sometimes adhering to one causes us to compromise another, but they guide our decisions on what matters.

- **We don't own the developer experience at Sourcegraph – we simply focus on it.** Sourcegraph engineers own the developer experience as a collective.
- **We ship open products.** Our products are open to contributions to anyone in the company, documented, and provide migration paths if necessary. Our decisions are clearly and publicly communicated for everyone to understand our reasoning. We want to make it simple for everyone to benefit from and work on Sourcegraph’s developer experience.
- **We bandage first, then plan for surgery.** Fix local problems first, then generalize if and only if it makes sense.
  - What we cannot take upon right now, we make its status clear and provide stewardship.
    - We should never refuse to fix a "now" problem in favour of a long-term solution, only to cancel the fix because the priorities changed in between. More than not addressing the issue at hand, it prevents our users from fixing the problem for themselves in the meantime.
  - We deliver small and iterative experiments and collect feedback. We communicate regularly on their status to enable others to provide inputs. We should reap the benefits of what we work on as we go, not at the end.
- **We listen and observe.** Our users often know best what's immediately good for them because they are the ones experiencing it every day.
  We are not a dependency. We actively seek to avoid blocking product teams. We focus on improving and expediting progress, not being critical to it.

## Sourcegraph instances operated by us

We also maintain various instances of Sourcegraph which include:

- [sourcegraph.com (dotCom)](https://sourcegraph.com)
  - [Continuously deployed](../../dev/process/deployments/index.md#continuous-deployment-process) on the following schedule "09:00 UTC on Monday, 06:00 UTC rest of weekdays". To trigger a deployment refer to the [Deploying a code change to DotCom](../devops/deploy-code-change.md) document.
- [S2](https://golinks.io/s2)
  - Managed instance which is continuously deployed with a [GitHub action](https://golinks.io/s2-deploy) that runs every hour between 8am and 10pm UTC on weekdays.
  - For more information see [S2](../../dev/process/deployments/instances.md#sourcegraphsourcegraphcom-s2)
- [k8s](https://k8s.sgdev.com) aka "dogfood" for more information refer to the [Instances document](../../dev/process/deployments/instances.md)
- [Scaletesting](https://scaletesting.sgdev.org) for more information see [scaletesting](../../dev/tools/scaletesting.md)

## Tech stack

- We primarily build tools and libraries in Go, with a dash of bash scripting in between.
- We also operate [CI infrastructure](../../dev/tools/infrastructure/ci/index.md) with Kubernetes and Terraform.
