# Frontend Platform: Other responsibilities

This page lists some of the other reponsibilities of the [Frontend Platform
team](./index.md).

## @frontend-devs

The [Frontend Platform team](./index.md) maintains the canonical list of engineers at Sourcegraph who focus primarily on frontend development. These engineers all have expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, and React, and maybe be called on to:

- give their opinions on frontend tooling at Sourcegraph
- review frontend PRs
- do frontend interviews and assignment grading

These people are available under the `@frontend-devs` alias on both Slack and [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/frontend-devs) (the two lists are kept in sync). Please contact the Frontend Platform team to add or remove someone from the list.

Note that this is _not_ intended to be a comprehensive list of people with frontend expertise! Some full-stack engineers are not included in @frontend-devs because the primarily do backend development at Sourcegraph, or they aren't very familiar with React, etc.

## Frontend Crew

Frontend Crew is a biweekly, technically-focused get-together for all frontend (or frontend-curious) developers at the company. The idea is similar to a "guild" in the [Spotify model](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf):

> A Guild is a more organic and wide-reaching “community of interest”, a group
> of people that want to share knowledge, tools, code, and practices. Chapters
> are always local to a Tribe, while a guild usually cuts across the whole
> organization.
