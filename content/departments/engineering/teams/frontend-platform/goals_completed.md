## FY2023

### Q1

The main focus for Q1 was laying the groundwork to meet our contractual WCAG compliance requirements by the end of FY2023. We also reduced the flakiness of E2E tests by refactoring them, assigning ownership, and providing guidance for writing better tests.

- [Refactor E2E testing](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/31206)

- [Documentation and planning on WCAG 2.1 AA compliance](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/31200)

## FY2022

- [Design refresh](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/introducing-sourcegraphs-new-ui/) gives Sourcegraph a more modern look and feel and a better user experience by adding refined search results design, renewing focus on code, improving layouts, unifying headers and navigation, and promoting extensibility.
- [Wildcard Component Library](https://storybook.sgdev.org/?path=/story/wildcard-alert--alerts) provides a base for growth, helps maintain consistency, enables faster FE development, and pays off technical debt.
- [UI performance improvements](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/24869) enhance both actual and perceived page rendering performance.

## FY2021

- Progress on design debt throughout the web app where the web team owns the design: repo page areas and panels, navigation and headers, general theming, and the blob page (file viewer).
