## Describing Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph is a code AI platform: “software that builds software”. Our code graph powers Cody, the most powerful and accurate code AI for writing, fixing, and maintaining code, and Code Search, helping devs explore their entire codebase and make large-scale migrations and security fixes. Our customers include 4 of the top 10 banks, 4/5 FAANG companies, government organizations, Uber, Plaid, and many other companies building the software that pushes the world forward.

## Describing the code AI platform

The code AI platform is a combination of the code graph, Sourcegraph tools and LLMs which collectively power Cody and Code Search, giving devs and engineering leaders a complete understanding of their codebase. The code AI platform has four foundational elements: the code graph, tools, APIs and Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Code graph

The code graph contains all your code, and all the info about your code. Sourcegraph’s technology turns the unstructured nature of code and code metadata into structured data to power Cody’s best-in-class contextual awareness.

### Tools

Tools and workflows are the unique capabilities and atomic actions built into the code AI platform. These include Batch Changes and Code Insights, which are utilized by Code Search (and in the future, Cody).

### APIs

Developers can build their own custom tools on top of the Sourcegraph platform via the API, taking advantage of the unique code graph, embeddings, and tools.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

Sourcegraph gives teams the freedom to choose the best large language model to fit their needs.

Cody is free for individuals; simply download your preferred extension and connect it to your Sourcegraph.com account to get started with your own personal AI programming buddy.

## Cody differentiators

### Powerful & accurate

Cody leverages Sourcegraph’s code graph to fetch code context, resulting in more precise outputs in line with an organization’s codebase and best practices. This accuracy is applied to a wider range of AI coding assistant functionality and use cases.

### Universal

Cody works on all your code from all code hosts, and will integrate with all other code-related tools, regardless of vendor. Cody provides a standard interface to integrate LLMs, allowing organizations to use which LLM they’d prefer.

### Scalable & secure

Sourcegraph is trusted by the most discerning devs and companies, including ⅘ FAANG, 4/10 top US banks, Uber and GE. The same scalability and security practices extend to Cody: a zero retention policy on both inputs and outputs, respecting all code host permissions, and industry-leading indemnity.
