# Source Department

The Source department consists of a related set of teams who manage nearly all aspects of interfacing with code hosts. These teams will grow in time, but are small and scrappy, with some in maintenance-mode for now. Source is taking on tremendous challenges in the coming year, expanding our native support beyond Git for huge industry customers on Perforce, SVN and CVS.

We provide value to Sourcegraph by ensuring Sourcegraph can reliably index code from any code hosts. For more details, read our [Source Department strategy](strategy.md)
