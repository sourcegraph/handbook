# Source Strategy & Mission

## Strategy

The Source team builds value for Sourcegraph by ensuring customers can index and secure all of their code regardless of code host and auth provider.

We believe this is critical for building a long-term defensible value for Sourcegraph as all other code-search solutions are focused on searching across and individual repo or code host.

## Mission

The Source teams is responsible for the syncing, storing, and securing of code in Sourcegraph's code AI platform. We are putting the Source in Sourcegraph.

We are building a foundation on which the rest of Sourcegraph stands. No other part of Sourcegraph can work without source code and properly managed access to it.

Source makes Sourcegraph's code AI platform _universal_, by allowing it to access any code host, through any authentication and authorization provider, that customers require.

We are building a product for site-admins and a platform for engineers at Sourcegraph.

What we build is reliable, predictable, maintainable, debuggable.

Sourcegraph site-admins trust the tools we build for them. They enjoy using them, because they help them get their job done faster and more easily, with less ambiguity.

Engineers at Sourcegraph love to use our APIs because they are reliable and never leak: users of our APIs don't have to worry about how gitserver, or repo-updater, authz providers, or anything else works.
