# Release Team

## Mission

Enable any Sourcegraph customer or user to trial or run (in production) Sourcegraph in a way that is compatible with their environment, supports their level of technical expertise, and allows them to easily access the value that our product provides. Make it as easy as possible to access this value, and to maintain it going forwards by easily staying up to date with Sourcegraph's latest developments.

### Requesting our support

Feel free to direct simple questions to us in #discuss-release-ship in Slack. As a rule of thumb, anything that is not documented in our handbook or [docs](https://sourcegraph.com/docs) usually indicates it is not a simple question (e.g. feature requests) and should follow our [support request guidelines](./#support-request-guidelines) below.

- This channel _is_ regularly checked and well-monitored
- So please do **NOT** directly message or CC an engineer‚Äîthis is to try and protect their focus
- Instead, if it‚Äôs urgent, please mention `@release-team` in the channel and we'll ensure it gets the best response

### Support request guidelines

Support requests related to our [areas of ownership](./#responsibilities) should follow this process:

1. Make sure there is an issue‚Äîif there's not, please create one and include:
   - A short description of the ask
   - A more detailed explanation of the background, the context and the challenge that needs solving
   - Any guidance related to the impact this is having
   - Any extra information that could help us solve or prioritize this
2. Ensure lable `team/release` is added to the issue
3. Ensure that the issue is added to the "[Release](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/362)" board in GitHub
4. Anything without a status is checked and triaged weekly - so this is enough for feature requests or less urgent issues
5. If you think this needs eyes üëÄ sooner
   - Within a few hours ‚û°Ô∏è message in #discuss-release-ship
   - ASAP ‚û°Ô∏è message in #team-releases and CC `@release-team`
