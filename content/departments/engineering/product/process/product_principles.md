# Product Principles

> NOTE: This page is a stub that includes only a single Product Principle, more will be added in future.

## What are Product Principles

Product Principles are the fundamental values that we use to validate every action, decision, or move the product team makes.

They compliment our Product Vision (where we want to go), Product Strategy (what we'll do) and our KPIs (have we been successful) by outlining how we'll get there.

## Our Product Principles

### Prioritise long-term sustainable growth over short-term

We believe that Sourcegraph will be a long-term enduring business to achieve our goal of making it so everyone can code. To support this, we should not build any feature that encourages short-term usage but may have a detrimental impact on our reputation or perception with our users. These include features considered dark or anti-patterns (e.g. default opt-ins, misleading UX) as well as intrusive or disruptive user notifications (e.g. hard to dismiss banners, context-unaware pop-ups etc.).

We believe that our growth will be driven by solving developer's painpoints and making them more productive. We don't need to rely on any cheap tricks or "hacks" to drive our business.
