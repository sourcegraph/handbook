### Product Management and Product Marketing

Product Management and Marketing must work closely together to successfully create and launch products. Because of this, it's important to be clear on what the shared and unique responsibilities are within the working relationship.

Shared areas of ownership where both teams contribute are:

- Market research, including personas, ideal customer profiles, etc.
- Competitive positioning and analysis
- [Go to market planning](./rollout_process.md)
- [Customer communications](../index.md#talking-to-customers-and-stakeholders)

Since we have the same goal of launching products that drive adoption and revenue, we don't experience a lot of conflict over the shared ownership. When we do, though, we use the [clean escalation](../../../../../company-info-and-process/communication/conflicts.md#clean-escalation) process to get to the best decision.
