# Cross-product projects

## What are cross-product projects?  

Cross-product projects are priorities that: 

1. Require the consistent collaboration or attention of multiple engineering teams 
2. Are ongoing beyond the scope of a single quarter's work
3. Have high enough impact that it justifies the use of this process

## Why do we have cross-product projects? 

Projects that meet the above criteria have higher risk of failure without additional process, because: 

1. It's more difficult for individual team stakeholders to prioritize across teams if no one's focused on the project-level priorities
1. It's more difficult to track and collaborate with many stakeholder teams on the same project than to have an owner and process for ensuring project inputs and outputs are routed effectively 

## Cross-product project components

### Owner 

The owner of a cross-product project takes on this responsibility in addition to their current role.

Owning a cross-product project is neither a role change nor a title change. 

#### Ownership responsibilities

The project owner is directly responsible for:

- Setting the vision, strategy, and goals of the project
- Maintaining effective collaboration with all other project stakeholders
- Leading planning and managing dependencies for the project
- Creating scalable, repeatable processes for tracking and managing project inputs
- Ensuring the cross-product project handbook pages are maintained and up-to-date
- Reporting to executive leadership on a cadence befitting the project

#### Ownership commitment

Cross-product projects can require a range of priority, depending on the work involved and the speed desired. To ensure all stakeholders of the owner's original role, the cross-product project, and product leadership are aligned on the relative priority, we note a relative commitment. 

A "50-50" split commitment means the project is equal in priority to the owner's other responsibilities, so the top-priority half of [this project's tasks] and [the other responsibilities] will get done. 

### Slack channel

Every cross-product project should have a public slack channel named #cpp-[project_name]. 

### Handbook page 

Every cross-product project has a handbook page describing relevant project components. These usually include: 

- The goal of the project
- Concrete examples of what the project is and is not
- The current project strategy and processes
- Links to project resources (such as GitHub labels, meeting notes, research folders, roadmaps)
