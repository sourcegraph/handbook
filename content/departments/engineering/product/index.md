# Product

We strive to make the following true:

- The team is working on the most important things on [our strategy](../../../strategy-goals/strategy/index.md), and that it is communicated well both inside and outside of Sourcegraph.
- Each teammate has the customer and product context needed about customer problems, likely future priorities, possible solutions, etc. to perform their work effectively.

## Contact

You can reach us at the #product channel or @product-team on Slack. If you have ideas you want to pass on to the product team, check out the [surfacing product feedback](process/feedback/surfacing_product_feedback.md) page.
