# Product

> NOTE: On 2022-06-05 we renamed our department to Engineering from "Product & Engineering". We're still working on updating the handbook after that change.

The product team at Sourcegraph consists of [product management](process/index.md), [product design](design/index.md), and [Product Education](product_education/index.md). We strive to make the following true:

- The team is working on the most important things on [our strategy](../../../strategy-goals/strategy/index.md), and that it is communicated well both inside and outside of Sourcegraph.
- Each teammate has the customer and product context needed about customer problems, likely future priorities, possible solutions, etc. to perform their work effectively.

## Contact

You can reach us at the #product channel or @product-team on Slack. If you have ideas you want to pass on to the product team, check out the [surfacing product feedback](process/surfacing_product_feedback.md) page.

## Product team initiatives

The product team takes on special initiatives that are not strictly tied to product delivery and they are tracked [in GitHub](https://github.com/sourcegraph/engineering-tracker/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Product+Initiative%22).

To create a new initiative, go to the [new issue screen](https://github.com/sourcegraph/engineering-tracker/issues/new/choose) for the [engineering-tracker repo](https://github.com/sourcegraph/engineering-tracker) and choose `Product Initiative`; this will ensure it gets the correct label to be included in the search above.
