# Product Education Team Expectations

## All Team Members

As an individual contributing member for the Product Education team, I will…

1. Accept the quest to understand our customers: who they are, the problems they have, and the outcomes they desire.
1. Be the advocate for educational content that builds a customer’s: Knowledge, Skill, Habit, Environment, and Motivation.
1. Be reliable: set appropriate expectations, do what you say you will do, and keep track of yourself.
1. Be organized and accountable for your efforts: keep track of your activities and take detailed notes (these are used for communicating our progress company-wide); Prioritize and execute your commitments in a timely fashion.
1. Focus on getting things done, while identifying and removing (or seek help in removing) distractions.
1. Celebrate success.
1. Challenge yourself to do things right, but possess a willingness to experiment and learn from failure.
1. Deliver "bad/uncomfortable" news early; share knowledge with the team, including both success and failures.
1. Try something new: Avoid the status quo, and/or the temptation to do things because "that's how they've always been done."
1. Never feign knowledge, aka celebrate “stupid” questions; seek and ask for help from others instead of tackling it alone; understand the problem to be solved before starting any project.
1. Focus on experimentation and how to measure success in place of guesswork (even educated guesswork).
1. Assist with work in progress before taking on new tasks. Maintain a high-level understanding of our products, and the problems they solve; remain current with regard to the product roadmap.
1. Maintain awareness of Product, Engineering, and Customer Engineering activities (Slack, social me dia, conference attendance, jargon/key terminology, etc.).
1. Pause to sharpen the saw: read books/blogs, take a class, etc.
1. Acknowledge we are a team of humans: humans that get mad and frustrated; have bad days and weeks (or longer); have families, friends, and other responsibilities; as well as a variety of additional stresses that go well beyond the boundaries of work.
1. When possible, work to resolve differences “in person” (e.g. phone or video) instead of email or text, or seek out an open door (Jeff, Christina, or HR), if a problem can’t be resolved within the team.
1. Have honest conversations, exemplified by communicating challenges, blockers, and successes frequently and openly, while maintaining civility and a promoting professional culture.
