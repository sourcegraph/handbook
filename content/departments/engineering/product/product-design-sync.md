# Product design sync

The product and design team meets weekly to discuss the most important cross-team product topics that need synchronous conversations. The meeting is on Thursday at 8 AM PT / 3 PM UTC. The meeting is recorded and recordings are posted to the #product channel.

## Working agreements

This meeting has a large attendance. To make it work, we use the following working agreements:

- We have a rotation for facilitating the sync. The facilitator is responsible for:
  - making sure topics to discuss are added to the doc prior to the meeting (see below)
  - time keeping
  - moderating conversations and in particular to push topics that are only useful to a few people to async or a follow-up
- Prior to the meeting, we list out topics to discuss at the top of the sync doc.
- We take 2 min at the beginning of the meeting to vote on the topics to discuss, 3 votes per person.
- We discuss each topic for 10 min max. After 10 min, we run a quick show of hands to extend the discussion to 5 more minutes. This allows us to be intentional about the time needed for a topic.
