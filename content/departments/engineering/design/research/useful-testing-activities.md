# Useful usability testing activities

Crafting effective activities for usability testing is a tricky business: the activities need to be clear, have a measurable success outcome, and avoid introducing bias through phrasing or direction.

When we find an effective activity for usability testing, it’s worth capturing it for future re-use. Not only does this make it easier to do future research, but by re-using the same activities, we can compare new research against previous research to understand how the experience is changing over time.

Here are some activities we’ve found to be effective for testing on the [user research instance](./user-research-instance.md):
