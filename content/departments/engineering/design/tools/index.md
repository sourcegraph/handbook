# Tools

We use a lot of tools on the Sourcegraph design team. Many of them are tools we use directly in our work, while other tools we use at the intersections with other teams.

Here’s what we use and how they fit together.

## Product and design

- [Figma](https://figma.com) is our primary design tool for all levels of fidelity and interactive prototyping.
- [Excalidraw](https://plus.excalidraw.com) is our tool for collaborative low-fidelity sketching and ideation.
- [ProductBoard](https://sourcegraph.productboard.com) is where product teams aggregate all user feedback.

## User research and data

- [Usertesting.com](https://usertesting.com) is our tool for unmoderated user research, which includes participant sourcing.
- [Calendly](https://calendly.com) is our tool for scheduling user interviews and sessions where it’s easier for the other participant to choose a time that works for them.
- [Looker](http://sourcegraph.looker.com) is our data warehouse so we can connect different data sources and analyze anything we need to.
- [Amplitude](https://analytics.amplitude.com/sourcegraph) is where we track and visualize events on the product.
- [Dovetail](https://dovetailapp.com) is a database-like tool that can be handy for managing data in user research.

## Internal collaboration and communication

- [GitHub](https://github.com) is where code reviews, issues, and project collaboration in development takes place.
- [Slack](https://sourcegraph.slack.com) is our primary internal communication tool.
- [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) and [Zoom](https://zoom.com) are our internal video calling tools. We default to Meet for product and design team calls, because it supports captions by default, which make our calls more inclusive for everyone.

- [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) helps us improve our writing.
- [1Password](https://1password.com) is where we store shared passwords and secrets.
