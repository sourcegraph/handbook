# Design research spike

Time required: Several weeks to a month

Notes:

- The nature of the project is atypical and estimating is less specific to design.
- This is more like pure blue sky experimentation or exploration, where design <> engineering <> product are exploring new space, outside of the typical project workflow.
- The project process may need to adjust around the exploratory nature of the effort. It is important to explicitly label these kinds of projects so that expectations are aligned accordingly.
- A large research project such as evaluating Notebooks Product Market Fit would fall into this category.
