# Brand Design Template: Extra Large

- Estimate: More than a month
- Notes:

  - When creating the issue, use the label `design-estimated-XL`
  - All phases for this project should involve a higher level of fidelity. Examples include additional test participants, multiple versions of designs, and more revision, and refinement than designs for smaller projects.
  - Ideally, design should be given sufficient time in the problem space to explore and research.
  - Design should be happening at least one iteration before engineering is planned. If user testing is required before or after design, this should be factored into the design time.
  - These efforts require close collaboration with the Product Manager to scope and define the user problems being solved.
