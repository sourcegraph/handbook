# Design Template: Small

- Estimate: One day to a week
- Notes:

  - When creating the issue, use the label `design-estimated-SM`
  - Useful when design resources are short, but the project needs to be moved forward. In this case, a small, consultive effort may be undertaken, a problem is small enough to require only design guidance
