# Design team goals

We have team-level design team goals to help us align and prioritize our
focus as a team over the following 3-6 months.

Our team-level goals cascade from the overall company [product vision and
strategy](../../index.md#product-vision-and-strategy), and each member of the design team
uses these to define their own individual goals.
