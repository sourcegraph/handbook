# Design team goals

The design team goals help us align and prioritize our focus as a team. These team-level goals cascade from the overall company [product vision and
strategy](../../index.md#product-vision-and-strategy). Additionally, each member of the design team
will define their own individual goals based on the career ladder, their product team objectives, and/or the design team goals.
