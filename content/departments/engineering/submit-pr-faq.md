# Submitting an item to the roadmap

We submit proposals in the form of Amazon-style PR-FAQs. Anybody can submit a PR-FAQ. PRFAQ can come from the exec team, or from any teammate at Sourcegraph. PR-FAQ are reviewed and prioritised by the VPEng/Prod with input from the exec team. PMs can help build and refine PR FAQs.

## How to submit a PR-FAQ

1. **Write a PRFAQ to describe your project**. You can use this [template](TODO). If you need help putting one together, post in #product to request help from a PM
2. **Get a PM assigned**. Raise a [PR-FAQ issue](), linking to your proposal. This will trigger an alert in #product and #engineering. Steve will assign a PM (or self-assign for non-customer facing/platform proposals) the issue to:
   1. Give a pre-read to the PR-FAQ and give (non-blocking) feedback
   2. Determine the impact of the proposal
   3. Set a Success Criteria for the project
3. **Steve will prioritise proposals.** <Monthly/quarterly>, Steve and the exec team will review proposals, with input from PMs (for features) and EMs( for tech-only) to decide what to move to the roadmap
4. **Job fair.** Projects moved to the roadmap will be submitted to the job fair.

## Success Criteria

A good success criteria should include:

- a leading indicator of success that can be measured in less than 3 months
- lagging indicators of success, such as customer adoption that typically take longer to see

## Impact

In 2, PMs will get a review of the PR-FAQ and recommend an impact rating. This is non-blocking and just a way for the exec team to focus on the most impactful proposals first in case there are too many of them.

We won don't use a formal/complicated frameowrk for evaluating impact for now, in order to keep it simple. We might change it later when we grow or if this does not work for us. But here’s a rough guideline for customer-facing features:

- High: Large ARR (>$3M ARR) or MAU (> 5,000 MAUs) impact, in the next 12 months. Fit with strategy. Well validated. Eg. Batch Changes, Insights, Own.
- Medium: Medium (>$1M ARR or 1,000 MAUs in the next 12 months). Fit with strategy. Elements of validation.
- Low: Unknown or unvalidated impact. No clear fit with strategy.

## PR-FAQ tips

- Try to keep the PR section no longer than 2 pages. FAQS can be longer.
- Try to avoid duplicate proposals or proposals about work already on some team’s roadmap. It’s a good idea to quickly survey what’s on team’s radars before raising a proposal.
