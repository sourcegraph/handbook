## Access AWS Account

AWS account access is managed via OKTA SSO.

### Access to an AWS account via cli/terraform:

> Note: requires [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

1. Add required profile to `~/.aws/config`` file:

```
[sso-session sg]
sso_start_url = https://d-92672e68f8.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-west-2
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access

[profile <YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>]
sso_session = sg
sso_account_id = <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = us-east-1
output = json
```

2. Login via SSO

```sh
aws sso login --profile <YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>
```

Note: if login does not work, it means either your Entitle request was not approved yet or you miss required permission. Ask for help in `#wg-aws-access` channel.

### Access to an AWS account via web console:

1. Login to [OKTA](https://sourcegraph.okta.com/)

2. Choose `AWS SSO` tile.

3. Click given account tile and then `Management console` button.

Note: if given account tile is not visible, it means either your Entitle request was not approved yet or you miss required permission. Ask for help in `#wg-aws-access` channel.

## Delete AWS Account

You can only delete AWS accounts which belong to your team. To delete an AWS account:

1. Delete AWS account [here](https://sourcegraph.sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/-/blob/cloud/aws/variables.tf)

2. Open Pull Request and ask for approval in #discuss-cloud-ops channel.

3. [For Cloud Operations] After merging PR, follow [instructions](https://sourcegraph.sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/infrastructure/-/blob/cloud/aws/README.md#create-new-aws-account)

## FAQ

### How can I use AWS IAM Users credentials for automation?

We strongly recommend using AWS SSO role instead of using IAM user credentials for automation. However if you need IAM user credentials for any reason, they are only allowed in non-production accounts.

### How Terraform Cloud is accessing production accounts?

Terraform Cloud uses [dynamic credentials integration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/aws-configuration) and does not store any credentials.
