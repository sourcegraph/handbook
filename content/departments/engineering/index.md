# Engineering

The Engineering department at Sourcegraph consists of 4 functions:

- [Development](dev/index.md)
- [Product Management](product/index.md)
- [Design](design/index.md)

We work together to build a product that developers love and that solves big problems for our customers.

> NOTE: On 2022-06-05 we renamed our department to Engineering from "Product & Engineering". We're still working on combining and flattening the handbook structure after that change.
