# Engineering

The Engineering department at Sourcegraph consists of:

- [Engineering](engineering/index.md)
- [Product Management](product/index.md)
- [Design](product/design/index.md)
- [Product Education](product/product_education/index.md)

We work together to build a product that developers love and that solves big problems for our customers.

> NOTE: On 2022-06-05 we renamed our department to Engineering from "Product & Engineering". We're still working on combining and flattening the handbook structure after that change.
