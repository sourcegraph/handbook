## What's in a feature?

For every feature we ship, consider:

#### Build

- **Security:** Make it secure, because our customers trust us with very sensitive code and other data, and we need to continually earn and retain that trust.
- **Reliability:** Make it stable and robust, because devs don't trust flaky or incorrect results.
- **Speed:** Make it fast, because devs won't use something 10+ times daily if it's slow.
- **Scalability:** Make it work at large scale, such as big monorepos or 100,000s of repositories.
- **Documentation:** Add and update documentation for the new feature.
- **Accessibility:** Make it accessible to a broad set of users (including keyboard accessibility).
- **Observability:** Help admins debug, manage, and scale the functionality.
- **Telemetry:** Gather the (minimum) data needed for us to understand how the feature is being used and improve it.
- **Backward-compatibility:** Make it smooth to upgrade from past versions and adapt usage to the newest version.
- **Forward-compatibility:** Anticipate the feature's future evolution (where possible, and without over-building today).
- **Admin experience:** Give an admin the visibility and controls they need to roll out and manage the feature.

#### Feedback

- **Iteration feedback:** Iterate with our existing customers and gather user feedback as early as possible.
- **Usage/value analytics:** Show how the feature is being used to users and admins, communicate the value to the customer's business, and identify opportunities for more value.

#### Launch

- **Marketing:** Update all marketing content to reflect the new feature (such as our about site, readmes, extension descriptions, slides, etc.).
- **Announcement:** Draft the eventual announcement of the feature early (in blog post form, along with a changelog entry and major docs changes), and update it as you iterate.
- **Pricing/packaging:** Decide which plans include this feature and whether its code will be open-source or not.

What's intentionally NOT in this list (but would be plausible items for a similar list at other companies):

- **~~Localization~~:** We don't yet see the need to localize Sourcegraph for non-English languages or different regions.
- **~~Offline/mobile~~:** We target online desktop users right now. (Note: This is separate from supporting airgapped instances of Sourcegraph within corporate networks, which is important.)
- **~~Abuse prevention~~:** Because Sourcegraph is an enterprise product used in isolated instances within companies, we can rely on admins for the very limited moderation necessary (such as if a search context with an offensive name is created).
- **~~Public usage~~:** We target organizations' Sourcegraph instances (Cloud managed instances and customer self-managed or jointly managed instances), not Sourcegraph.com. Presume for any feature that it's not worth doing extra work to make it work on Sourcegraph.com (and disable it on Sourcegraph.com with a feature flag if needed).
- **~~Secrecy/surprise~~:** We almost never care about keeping a feature secret prior to announcement. It's still important to avoid confusing users and customers about pre-release features and future plans.
