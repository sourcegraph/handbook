## Product-Focused Planning

Each planning cycle (currently quarterly), the overall goals come from the exec
team to make sure we're driving towards the destination we've set for ourselves
as a company in our strategy and roadmap.

It's the product teams – engineering and product together – that have the
expertise, context and pride of ownership to be best suited to propose the
highest impact work that fits those goals.

Per-team planning reviews are where we come together to ensure we're happy with
where we're headed at each planning cycle. TPMs will pull together reviews for
each team each planning cycle to include interested members of the exec team,
the leads of the product team (at least the EPD triad) and other interested
stakeholders. A planning review will consist of content to cover at least the
following outline:

- Retrospective: How well did we do in accomplishing our goals from last Q?
- Status: How well is the product serving the needs of our customers and the
  business?
- Plans: What work is being proposed for this planning cycle, how does it meet
  the business goals and how does it serve the needs of our customers?

Note, not every team will have work to do that applies to every goal every
quarter. Likewise, not every work item is expected to meet a goal
