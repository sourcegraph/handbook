## Product-Focused Planning

Each planning cycle (currently quarterly), the overall goals come from the exec
team to make sure we're driving towards the destination we've set for ourselves
as a company in our strategy and roadmap.

It's the product teams – engineering and product together – that have the
expertise, context and pride of ownership to be best suited to propose the
highest impact work that fits those goals.

Per-team planning reviews are where we come together to ensure we're happy with
where we're headed at each planning cycle. TPMs will pull together reviews for
each team each planning cycle to include interested members of the exec team,
the leads of the product team (at least the EPD triad) and other interested
stakeholders. A planning review will consist of content to cover at least the
following outline:

- **Retrospective:** How well did we do in accomplishing our goals from last Q?
  What data to you have to support those conclusions?
- **Status:** How well is the product serving the needs of our customers and the
  business? How well have you hit your metrics targets?
- **Plans:** What work is being proposed for this planning cycle, how does it meet
  the business goals and how does it serve the needs of our customers? What
  data are you using to drive your planning?
- **Success Metrics:** what KPIs and targets have you set to measure the success
  of this work?
- **Risks/Open Questions/Needs:** What are the biggests risks? What are the
  mitigations? What guidance would you like from the exec team? Do you
  have everything you need to be successful?
- **Excluded:** What alternatives have you rejected for this Q and why? Will they
  be on the team's roadmap for the future?

Note, not every team will have work to do that applies to every goal every
quarter. Likewise, not every work item is expected to meet a strategic goal.
