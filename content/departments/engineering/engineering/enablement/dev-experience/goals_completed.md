## FY23

### Q1

The focus for Q1 was CI stability and observability. We helped the company meet our SOC2 requirements by driving complaince efforts around several controls, introducing a process for surfacing and collaborating on cross-team pain points, and publishing content to help our teammates understand CI/CD and codebase architecture at Sourcegraph.
