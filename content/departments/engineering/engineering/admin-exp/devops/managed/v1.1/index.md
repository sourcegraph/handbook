# Managed Instance v1.1

This documentation details significant changes of Managed Instance v1.1 comparing to the previous version.

Unless we explictly call it out, you may assume things are unchanged.

## Architecture

The largest architecture changes are the externalizing several components to
GCP-managed services.

### Postgres

<span class="badge badge-note">SOC2/CI-79</span>

Postgres database now uses a single [Cloud SQL] instance, which is a fully managed service by GCP. It provides fully automated daily backup with point-in-time-recovery and retains for 7 days. We also have on-demand backup prior to upgrade to provide fallback plan for unanticipated events.

### Object Storage

Object storage now uses [Google Cloud Storage] (GCS) and it's a managed service provided by GCP.
