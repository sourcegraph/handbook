# Code Graph engineering org

The Code Graph org's mission is to make discovering, learning, analyzing, and editing code easier, no matter how complex it is, where it’s stored, or how experienced you are.

An overview of our strategy can be found [here](../../../../strategy-goals/strategy/code-graph/).

You can find our roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/214/views/34).

## Teams

Each team within our org implements a different _verb_ on the code graph:

- The [Search teams](./search/index.md) enable _searching_ the code graph
  - [Search Core team](./search/core.md)
  - [Search Product team](./search/product.md)
- The [Code Intelligence team](./code-intelligence/index.md) enables _navigating_ and _inspecting_ the code graph
- The [Code Insights team](./code-insights/index.md) enables _measuring_ and _tracking_ the code graph
- The [Batch Changes team](./batch-changes/index.md) enables _changing_ the code graph
