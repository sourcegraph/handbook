# Job Fair

Sourcegraph assigns work using a Job Fair system, treating all engineering work as projects with business champions, tied to KPIs, and allowing the organization to work as a single, flexible labor pool of freelancers, simultaneously optimizing for business impact, velocity, and engineering career growth.

## Finding a project to work on

You can find the currently open projects in the [Sourcegraph Job Fair Project List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jP5atmrBSJKubvk3rFuwXiXKLwfyxCGFDE4fqbpVmvU/edit#gid=0).

## Submitting an item to the roadmap

Before being added to the job fair, projects need to be prioritised and [added to the roadmap](./adding-to-roadmap.md). The first step is to raise a PR-FAQ.
