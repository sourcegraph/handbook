# Job Fair

Sourcegraph assigns work using a Job Fair system, treating all engineering work as projects with business champions, tied to KPIs, and allowing the organization to work as a single, flexible labor pool of freelancers, simultaneously optimizing for business impact, velocity, and engineering career growth.

## Summary

- Projects are described in PR-FAQs (Press release-FAQ). PR-FAQs describe ambitious goals that take several quarters of work several engineers to complete.
- We mostly plan in 3-month cycle, with off-cycle adjustments as needed. In each planning cycle, we build an actionable plan for the next 3 months, and a more tentative plan for the 3 months after that. We aim to have a high certainty 3-month roadmap, and a low-certainty 6-month roadmap.
- Before each cycle, we ask everyone at Sourcegraph to propose new projects (by raising a PR-FAQ) or to propose continuing an existing project (by adding step to an existing PR-FAQ).

## Planning

### Planning summary

Planning works in 3-months cycles, that are organized in the following way:

1. Call for input from sales, strategy updates and clarification
1. Call for projects (PR-FAQs or a new step in an existing PR-FAQ)
1. Call for staffing preferences of engineers
1. Global prioritization against the (MSEM)[../../strategy-goals/msem], ARR opportunities, and technical goals, so as to saturate engineering capacity.
1. Cycle starts! Off-cycle PR-FAQs are welcome, either to be considered for the next cycle or to make off-cycle adjustments.

### Planning sequence

In what follows:
- a **cycle** is 3 months of work leading to a quarterly release (eg. Starship). Note that the release cycle is decorrelated from our financial planning cycle.
- **D** is the day the (development) cycle starts, and **D+90** is the Starship release date.

- **D-45**: Reminder to GTM to collect top 10asks/reminder to everybody else to create PR-FAQs. Note that PR-FAQs can be raised on an ongoing basis, this is just a reminder.
- **D-30 days**: top 10 asks from GTM are ready and shared publicly
- **D-23**: all PR-FAQs are submitted (some PR-FAQs can also be submitted off-cycle on a rolling basis, but that should be a minority of them)
- **D-23 to D-17**:
  - The prioritization team (PM/EMs/HoX) reads PR-FAQs and creates a recommendation (or set of!) based on MSEM, revenue goals, and technical goals.
  - In parallel, engineers express their preferences on a set of PRFAQs they’d like to join if prioritized.
- **D-17 to D-10**: prioritization week: prioritize the quarter ahead. 1 hour of job fair prioritization meeting every day until done
- **D-10 to D-3**: staffing week 
  - We start by prioritizing the next release
  - Then the release after that (more uncertain as will be re-assessed in the next cycle)
- **D-3 to D**: buffer, cycle starts
- **D((: Steve (or delegate) posts in #announce-company to share projects that have been greenlit.
- **D+7**: Updates to the customer facing roadmap by PMs and marketing are done.

This cadence will apply to most of PR-FAQs. A minority of PR-FAQs will also be greenlit on a rolling basis. If this process looks rigid, it isn’t. We’ll make adjustments in cycle if we have good reasons to make them. But having a planning cadence provides visibility to the team on when to submit PR-FAQs ideally (before planning!), when and how prioritization happens, and how far ahead we plan the roadmap and why.
Note that as we go, prioritization will be easier and easier as we’ll have planned 2 cycles ahead and will only be making adjustments.

### Roles and responsibilities

TPMs are responsible for coordinating the cycle:sending calendar invites, reminders, organizing job fair meetings). PMs are responsible for the overal quality level of PR-FAQs (clear success criteria).

## Why job fair

### Benefits of job fair

#### Known trade-offs





#### Finding a project to work on

Greenlit projects are in the [Job Fair project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/302/views/18).
Projects are assigned on a rolling basis. Feel free to drop a comment in PR-FAQ issues and let your manager know if you're interested in joining a project.

## Submitting an item to the roadmap

Before being added to the job fair, projects need to be prioritised and [added to the roadmap](./adding-to-roadmap.md). The first step is to [raise a PR-FAQ](https://github.com/sourcegraph/pr-faqs/issues/new/choose).

See [PRFAQ guidelines](prfaq-process.md).

## Communications

Job Fair updates are posted weekly in the #job-fair slack channel to communicate the progress of projects and action items that are needed.

As projects progress throughout each iteration of Job Fair, any staffing or prioritization changes will be determined by the Job Fair leadership team. These changes will be communicated to the Technical Program Manager, Tech Leads and any other DRIs involved with that project.
