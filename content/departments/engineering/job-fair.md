# Job Fair

Sourcegraph assigns work using a Job Fair system, treating all engineering work as projects with business champions, tied to KPIs, and allowing the organization to work as a single, flexible labor pool of freelancers, simultaneously optimizing for business impact, velocity, and engineering career growth.

## Finding a project to work on

Greenlit projects are in the [Job Fair project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/302/views/18).
Projects are assigned on a rolling basis. Feel free to drop a comment in PR-FAQ issues and let your manager know if you're interested in joining a project.

## Submitting an item to the roadmap

Before being added to the job fair, projects need to be prioritised and [added to the roadmap](./adding-to-roadmap.md). The first step is to [raise a PR-FAQ](https://github.com/sourcegraph/pr-faqs/issues/new/choose).

See [PRFAQ guidelines](prfaq-process.md).

## Communications

Job Fair updates are posted weekly in the #job-fair slack channel to communicate the progress of projects and action items that are needed. 

As projects progress throughout each iteration of Job Fair, any staffing or prioritization changes will be determined by the Job Fair leadership team. These changes will be communicated to the Technical Program Manager, Tech Leads and any other DRIs involved with that project.
