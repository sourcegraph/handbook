# Demo day

Directly following Company Meeting twice per month, Engineering department members present the latest features and improvements to Sourcegraph.

Demos should be short and easy to prepare for, so that as many team members as possible are able to participate. Demos are recorded for folks across the company, customers, and future team members to reference.

## Overview

All demos are:

- Features, changes, small bug fixes, or behind the scenes engineering work that are **merged** into main and are **live** (i.e. on [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/search) or [k8s.sgdev.org](https://k8s.sgdev.org)).
- Presented (ideally) by one of the teammates who built it.
- Between 3-5 mins. Live demos can be longer than 3 minutes to account for additional setup time (& you get extra SG points)!
- Can be recorded ahead of time and will be played for attendees (optional). If recorded, please limit the video to 3 minutes or less.

We are here to help and support you as you prepare for your demo. Kylie or your team's PM will work with you to make sure that you can articulate in the simplest way possible why this new feature is awesome for our community and customers.

## Structure

**1. Intro:** Your name and team

> Hi, my name is \<name>, and I’m on the \<your team> team. Today I’m presenting \<name of your change>.

**2. What/why:** What problem does this change solve? For who? Why did we build it?

> We built this because \<reason>.

OR

> Previously, \<how it was before>, and now \<why it’s way better>.

**3. Describe:** the change, how it works, and demo

> Here it is in action. \<show demo and briefly explain>

## Tips for presenting

- Turn on do not disturb and/or Slack notifications off
- Only show 1 tab in 1 window (if possible)
- (If you want to record—here's some helpful tips of how to use Loom)
