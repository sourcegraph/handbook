# $MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH Security Review: Container Images

This is a Release Blocker issue to nudge the Release Captain to check
with the Security Team whether there are any security patches that must be
applied to Sourcegraph Container Images before the release is published.

See [RFC 678](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v0TXVLPCNA42cQwIYeGLICoy6zfK9KprMRpMa2Fn6IE/edit#) for more information.

The Security Team should use **this** issue to communicate and coordinate
actions to meet our obligations under the [Vulerability Management Process](../../../../security/vulnerability-management-process.md).

After all items are resolved, this issue can be closed an the release should be
considered unblocked by the Security Assessment.
