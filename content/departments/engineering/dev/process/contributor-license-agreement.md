# CLA

CLA stands for Contributor License Agreement. It is a [legal document](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/dev/CLA.txt) that some open source projects require contributors to sign before they can contribute code.

The primary purposes of a CLA are:

- To ensure the contributor has the right to license their contribution under the project's license. This avoids legal issues if someone contributes code they don't have rights to.
- Ensure the project has the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the contributed code.
- To protect the project from contributors trying to revoke the license or enforce their patents against it.

## FAQ

### Which Sourcegraph repositories DO NOT require a CLA?

For permissively licensed projects, contributors do **not** need to sign a CLA given that permissive license terms govern the use of such contributions. Read more about permissive licenses [here](./licenses#allowed-licenses-permissive-licenses).

### Examples of Sourcegraph repositories that DO NOT require CLAs:

- [sourcegraph/cody](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/cody)
- [sourcegraph/zoekt](https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt)
- [sourcegraph/conc](https://github.com/sourcegraph/conc)

### Which Sourcegraph repositories DO require a CLA?

For all (a) proprietary or (b) copyleft-licensed projects, contributors need to sign a CLA. To reduce the burden on contributors, limiting the CLA requirement to only contributions or changes involving 10 or more lines of code is ok.

Read more about copyleft licenses [here](./licenses#not-allowed-licenses-copyleft-licenses).

### What repository owned by Sourcegraph requires a CLA?

- [sourcegraph/sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph)

### Why do some projects require a CLA and others donâ€™t?

We decided not to add CLAs to permissive open source projects to onboard contributors faster and show that we are committed to keeping the project open source.
