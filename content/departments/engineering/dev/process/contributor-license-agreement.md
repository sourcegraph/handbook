# CLA

CLA stands for Contributor License Agreement. It is a [legal document](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/dev/CLA.txt) that some open source projects require contributors to sign before they can contribute code.

The primary purposes of a CLA are:

- To ensure the contributor has the right to license their contribution under the project's license. This avoids legal issues if someone contributes code they don't have rights to.
- Ensure the project has the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the contributed code.
- To protect the project from contributors trying to revoke the license or enforce their patents against it.
