# Engineering Ownership

The following table documents the ownership of our product and tech stack.

If you see an area that is missing, [figure out](../product/process/feedback/surfacing_product_feedback.md) who the right owner is and add it to the appropriate team. If you can't figure out who the right owner is, post in #eng-leads. It's up to all of us to keep this list up to date, and teams should be sure to add to it as their ownership areas change or grow.

## Owners files

Owners files work exactly like the CODENOTIFY files that we use currently, and can also help you find the owner of a certain bit of code:

- An OWNERS file can appear in any directory.
- Owners files are recursive, so an OWNERS file in a directory also applies to all subdirectories.
- The effective owners of a given file / directory are determined by the union of the owners of all parent directories.

OWNERS files and CODENOTIFY files use the same syntax, and notifications for both are implemented by the [Codenotify](https://github.com/sourcegraph/codenotify) tool. Owners files have some additional guidelines:

- It is preferred to list a team (e.g., @sourcegraph/frontend-platform) rather than individuals.
- If there is an individual with expertise in a given part of the code, who is not on the owning team (e.g., Thorsten Ball with sg), that person should be listed in OWNERS.

For questions about our use of owners files, please reach out on #discuss-dev-experience.
