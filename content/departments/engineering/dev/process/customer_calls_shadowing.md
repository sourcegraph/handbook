# Customer Calls Shadowing Rotation

Customer Calls shadowing is intended to give engineers more first hand experience working with customers,
expose them to pain points, and allow them to bring that experience back to their teams to increase our ability to deliver better products.

## How it works

- Each rotation is 1 week long and may consist of n+1 calls. By limiting it to one week we ensure that all engineers get to undertake at least one rotation in one calendar year.
- AE identifies calls they'd like engineers to attend and adds them to this sheet.
- Engineer signs up and indicates availability.

## Expectations

- Shadowing should not be used as a mechanism for an engineer to troubleshoot, debug, and solve specific issues. Our other existing processes should be used in these scenarios.

### Pre Call

- AE will send calendar invite to the engineer.
- AE to provide as much context to the engineer as well as set expectations.

### Post Call

- Engineer shares any notable insights
