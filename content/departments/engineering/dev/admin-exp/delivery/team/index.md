# Delivery Team README

Our README expands on our profile in [the company team directory](../../../team/index.md) and are meant to help us orient to one another.

- Brie [README](brie-readme.md)
- Kevin [README](kevin-readme.md)

The format, style, order, etc is up to each of us. Just make sure to include the following to the degree you feel at ease to do so; feel free to add/remove as you see fit:

- How I work
- When I work
- Where I work
- What I do
- Communication style
- Preferred learning styles
- Preferred way to receive feedback
- What kind of work do you find easiest to do when (for example, some folks write best at night or can focus more easily in the afternoon)
- Things I struggle with
- What you find enjoyable at work
- Things I love outside of work
- Other things to know about me
