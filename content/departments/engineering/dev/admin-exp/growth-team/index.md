## Vision

_Visitors to Sourcegraph clearly see the value of the product and are compelled to integrate it into their workflow and share it with friends and colleagues. _

This vision is necessarily broad because the growth-oriented goal for the team is the generation of Product Qualified Leads. These PQLs will generally be generated from users who find value in the product and integrate Sourcegraph into their daily routines. As such, this team will also impact the following objectives:

- Improve the retention of all users
- Increase the frequency of users from monthly active to daily active
- Expand usage in existing accounts

## Responsibilities and focus

In pursuit of goals related to growth, the team will own or contribute to the following:

- Researching how users become activated, sign-up, and generate PQLs
- Guiding and shaping the initial user journey of:
  - visitors to sourcegraph.com
  - authenticated users of Self-hosted installations
  - TBD: authenticated users to the cloud product
    - Cloud is working on this, but solutions here probably need to be influenced by user journeys developed for the self-hosted product and vice-versa
- Creation and optimization of in-product flows that result in:
  - Cloud sign-ups
  - Self-hosted installs
  - Distribution for product features that factor heavily in user activation, retention, and lead generation
- Coordination with Marketing on projects such as:
  - updates to the homepage
  - collaboration on campaigns that drive traffic to the product
- Experimental growth hacks that will result in increased traffic, sign-ups, and/or PQLs
