# Code Intelligence Platform cross-product owner

- Slack channel: #cp-code-intelligence-platform
- Owner: Joel Kwartler
- Owner split with other roles: 75-25 (this-other roles)

## Mission and ownership

The code intelligence cross-product owner focuses on all product, design, and engineering work necessary to achieve our [1-year vision](../../../../engineering/index.md#product-vision-and-strategy).

This ownership includes:

- Coordinating the product, engineering, and design teams to align on strategy, goals, and roadmaps for FY24
- Guiding product research and synthesis
- Creating new channels for feedback and research 
- Maintaining a deep understanding of the market for similar devtools and functionalities

## Success metric

When the first phase of this project concludes on Jan 1 2023, it is successful if we have: 

1. A defined strategy to create the code intelligence platform.
2. Goals and a roadmap to execute the strategy.
3. Started design and engineering exploration and testing on the roadmap.

Note: we won’t expect these outcomes to be written in stone – if we’re learning and iterating successfully into 2023, it’s likely our roadmap will adapt and change (especially as we get further into the future, like FY24Q2-Q3). 

Each of these terms deserves its own strict definition of success, as follows. 

### Good strategy 

We’ve arrived at a good strategy when we have something that is: 

1. Focused
  1. Easy to communicate to teammates and to customers 
  1. Not trying to be all things to all people, but makes concentrated deep bets
     1. There should be very clear answers to “things we are not going to do”, at the level of detail where we can keep a running list as necessary
  1. Contains only the critical path: if we could still achieve our vision without succeeding at [X], [X] is not part of our strategy
1. Actionable
  1. Teams understand the shared vision and their role in delivering on it, and are all positioned to succeed 
  1. We can answer to key prioritization and strategic questions based on our strategy 
1. Problem-oriented
  1. It’s clear how we solve the problems preventing our vision from becoming reality
  1. It’s clear how problems are related or dependent
1. Insight-driven
  1. Supported by user research
  1. Supported by data
  1. Solving the right problems
1. Cohesive
  1. The pillars of our strategy relate – we’re not trying to achieve two or three unrelated strategies at once 

### Good goals

We’ve arrived at good goals when we have goals that are:

1. Iterative 
  1. They’re fast to measure and re-measure  
  1. The faster/shorter timelines we can set on goals the sooner we know if we’re not on track
1. Specific
  1. Scoped to only the goals/problems needed to achieve our strategy 
1. Actionable
  1. We can solve the Drive our strategy 
1. Focused on outcomes (not outputs)
  1. Example: As we move to MAU pricing, it’s likely we have MAU metrics as a key KPI in many goals 

### Good roadmap

We’ve arrived at a good roadmap when it:  

1. Is validated to very likely achieve our goals
  1. (We validate our roadmap during this planning period) 
1. Matches our timeline 
  1. Meaning: a 9-month series of sequential problems (and features, for the nearer-in-time months we’ll build immediately starting Jan 1; it will get fuzzier the further out in time you go) 
1. Maps to owners, drivers, and teammates
1. Is publicly shareable with customers (and anyone)
  1. As a result, this means we must also focus on quality, confidence, and storytelling 

## Principles

In addition to our applicable [product principles](../../../../../strategy-goals/strategy/index.md#principles) and [design principles](../../../../engineering/design/product_design_principles.md), these are principles specifically for “what is Joel Kwartler doing as DRI” and “how can we work collaboratively to ensure we most effectively use the next three months”? 

* **Operate with autonomy and expertise**

    Joel Kwartler is the DRI for *how* we arrive at our strategy, not *what* our strategy is. We are all experts in various aspects of our users, features, and opportunities. This an initiative everyone will need to take an active part in.

    Consider that the work we do now sets us up for success in the following 9 months across our entire engineering department, and make sure this is a “high priority” on your personal todo list. It won't be possible to ignore this process and still successfully contribute to achieving our vision. 

    We will **push decisions down**: we want to define user outcomes and overall success metrics as a product/design team, but leave tactical planning decisions to each product-eng unit to reduce overhead. Planning work must focus on getting a prioritized list of customer outcomes and leave space for teams to figure out most details and iterate.

* **Build a shared point of view**

    We should effectively share the updates, learnings, and progress made every week across the team. Those updates will be posted in #cp-code-intelligence-platform. We will keep room for discussion/followup/questions/disagreements (all useful). 
    
    When we are at the research stages, teams will share a quick 1-paragraph written summary and 120-second loom with key findings (that’s ~7-9 teams so ~20 minutes of updates). Joel will then share a 120-second overall loom each week for less-involved stakeholders to get the highlights and to synthesize. This will let us avoid doubling efforts and ensure we all benefit from everyone’s work

* **Create strong convictions, weakly held**

    This is especially important here: we need to believe in something strongly to pursue it, and pivot quickly if we invalidate it. 

    For the sake of feedback, we should err on the side of picking any direction when we aren’t sure, and then seeing what reactions/feedback we get (vs leaving things open-ended too long). 

* **Be tactical and creative with our customer research**

    Examples of things we will do: more customer slack channels focused on product feedback;
    a product advisory board; synthesize previous research based on a new platform-focused lense.
