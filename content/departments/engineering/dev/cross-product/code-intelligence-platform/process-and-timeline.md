# Code Intelligence Platform strategy planning process and timeline

Note that this won’t be the #1 priority of prod+design until after sept 27 ([Strategic-readiness](../strategic/index.md) work comes first). 

> Tactical note: further specifics for each stage will be added on a rolling basis. 

## Kick off by aligning on the “why” | Sep 14 – Sep 30 (2 weeks including Cancun)

**Actions**

* Cancun workshop ([detailed process doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wb-YVUjlXNV4yqVtFjvv2-axnyk_7xan84XbwEK3StA/edit?usp=drive_open&ouid=110069214620879702746))
* Group async workshop
    * Initial understanding of “what is a code intelligence platform.”
    * Identify some of the knowledge gaps.
* Synthesis of Cancun workshop into excitement areas and research directions 

**Roles**

* Design: All designers involved together with their product partner, to maximize domain knowledge in this research and synthesis.
* Product: all PMs involved directly in this together with a single shared set of outputs
* Engineering: Key engineers involved with their product partners or with the overall group.

**Exit with** 

Initial agreement on a primary definition of “code intelligence platform,” possible competing interpretations worth filtering research against, and specific things we will need to learn more about.


Initially identify and explore specific knowledge gaps Oct 3 – Oct 14 (2 weeks)
Actions

Research planning
Identify further knowledge gaps and specific research questions via asking “what evidence do we have that this is true” of each of our assumptions
Share a framework for research so that each team isn’t coming up with this from scratch
Conduct research in domain areas
Existing market research
Ad-hoc research
Positioning
Reviewing existing resources (e.g. prospect use cases) from the lens of “code intelligence platform” rather than “code search.”
User archetypes and role from lens of “code intelligence platform” rather than “code search”

Roles

Design: All designers involved in research together with their product and engineering partners or with the overall group.
Product: PMs will focus on individual slices of the research we decide, as a team, it’s valuable to do (in order to parallelize this and move faster as a united team).
Engineering: Key engineers involved in research with their product partners or with the overall group.

Exit with 

Research findings and insights from a variety of perspectives that prove or disprove our assumptions on what a code intelligence platform must do to be valuable 10+ times a day for the average developer.
Initially synthesize platform-focused learning as a group and define “code intelligence platform” Oct 14 – Oct 21st (1 week)
Actions

Group workshop (async or sync)
Synthesize findings together
We all prepare async synthesis of our research, do 1 round of async feedback, 1 round of sync feedback, and continue async from there. 
This is 1 week because the timeline is entirely controlled by us (limited external dependencies) so we can cover this in 1 week 

Roles

Design: All designers involved in synthesis and definition.
Product: All PMs involved
Engineering: Key engineers involved in synthesis and definition.

Exit with 

Specific high-level opportunities and insights, specific customer-facing value areas that a code intelligence platform provides
Align on “code intelligence platform” strategy Oct 24 - Nov 4 (2 weeks)
Actions
Strategy workshop (some high level background): 
“What are the steps we need to take to go from our existing product to this vision?” 
(can be multiple paths)
From Scott Williamson: Here’s where we are, here are our challenges/why we are taking actions, here is what we are doing about it
How can we achieve each step? What are the risks to each step (or set of paths)? 
Which path do we think is most likely to succeed based on our research so far? 
Strategy doc
Define strategy together that meets our definition of “what makes a good strategy.”
Specific individuals assigned to make final decisions as needed based on input.

Roles
Design: All designers involved in aligning on the strategy.
Product: Every PM is an input provider here. If there are any important points where we cannot align as a team/have a distinct split, Joel Kwartler will facilitate Quinn Slack as a decider.
Engineering: Key engineers involved in aligning on the strategy.

Exit with

A Sourcegraph-wide product strategy to realize the vision. Teams have a shared strategy with ownership / non-overlapping goal areas that realize the Sourcegraph-wide strategy.
Identify goals and problems that need to be solved and in what order of dependency Nov 7 – Nov 18 (2 weeks)
Actions

Generative ideation / validation 
What is the full list of viable, feasible, desirable things we can pursue? 
TBD
Generative technical validation 
What can we do that we couldn’t do a year ago technically, that’s worth exploring in concert with product ideas? (examples that come to mind: SCIP, SSBC / executors, Compute, etc)
TBD
Async artifact as outcome
Define goals together that meet our definition of “what makes a good goal.”
Identify known problems and subproblems under each goal. Design challenge statements may be an effective format for these to make them actionable.
Product Advisory Board session.

Roles

Design: All designers involved in identifying and ordering goals to define the overall roadmap. These goals may be tied to specific feature teams or identified as higher-level.
Product: All PMs will help map dependencies, and surface any holistic goals that need to be solved by a shared effort. 
Engineering: Key engineer involved in identifying and ordering goals to define the overall roadmap of goals and problems , with a particular focus on known technical problems or known knowns.

Exit with

Collected set of opportunities and unsolved problems that match strategy, and necessary strategy updates. Shared overall roadmap and specific team roadmaps that are specific as to the problems to solve in the near term and less specific in the later term.
Joel Kwartler rough product roadmap deck that sales can use. 
Begin design exploration, testing, and iteration Nov 21 - Dec 16 (4 weeks)
Actions

Kick off two tracks of design efforts (higher-level, foundational and product-feature level). 
Each effort needs its own discovery / delivery process including problem definition, design exploration, technical exploration, prototyping, testing, and iteration.
Demo tests / strategy tests on first calls.
Start setting up research calls for mid-Oct and beyond.

Roles

Design:
Higher-level track: A small group of ~2-3 designers will focus on the problems in this track. The team will work with transparency and collaboration with the full design and product team and engineering partners should be involved.
Feature-level track: Existing product feature teams identify specific problems their team is best positioned to solve, and those team’s designers will focus on those problems together with their product and engineering triads.
Product:
Higher-level track: A few PMs will work with designers on any higher-level work (e.g., information architecture, interaction model, systems).
Feature-level track: All PMs working on specific aspects of our strategy.
Engineering: 
Higher-level track: Specified engineering partners to be directly involved in this to contribute with an engineering perspective and to help in building and validating prototypes.
Feature-level track: Existing product feature teams to identify specific individuals to contribute with an engineering perspective.

Exit with

No clear “exit,” but rather transition into overall delivery phase by continuing to carry out the iterative design/delivery process. Goals for the strategy and roadmap.
