## Success metric

The north star success metric for these efforts is iARR closed from [strategic customers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JFHacGYDIBd4pMSrKC3QV25YFkK2yBfM0dMd9An2sGE/edit#gid=1317478762).

## Principles

### Customer-facing work

To work best with strategic customers, I:

1. Move fast and build momentum within large organizations
1. Create and maintain a reputation of dependable partnership and delivery
1. Approach issues with recommendations and best practices, rather than a greenfield exploration point of view

### Operating within the engineering org

To work best with the teams and product stakeholders also involved in this work, I:

1. Partner closely with the product stakholders on prioritizing team roadmaps â€“Â I will not "go around" a product manager stakeholder and make direct requests of another team's engineers
1. Focus on surfacing tactical information that empowers our engineering teams, like timelines, specific customer details, and customer sentiment

## Process

1. [Weekly product engineering sync meeting](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MGUwaG5tMnE5a25sbW51dXEyamJ2NW45c3Ugam9lbEBzb3VyY2VncmFwaC5jb20&tmsrc=joel%40sourcegraph.com) for product stakeholders. We use this to stay closely aligned in priorities and roadmaps.
