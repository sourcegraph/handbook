## Mission and ownership

The strategic cross-product owner focuses on all strategic product and engineering work necessary to make strategic customers successful.

This ownership includes:

- Being the product contact for strategic sales and customer engineering teammates, and our strategic customers
- Working with sales and customer engineering to proactively surface engineering needs and obstacles and deliver solutions
- Partnering with strategic customers to shape aspects of our product roadmap together
- Shepherding deployment and feature rollouts at Strategic customers, from pre-mortem to post-mortem
- Prioritizing features across multiple engineering teams, alongside other product manager stakeholders, based on the TAM of all customers served
- Ensuring engineering and go-to-market teammates have the right information, resources, playbooks, and roadmaps to make our strategic customers successful

## Success metric

The north star success metric for these efforts is iARR closed from [strategic customers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JFHacGYDIBd4pMSrKC3QV25YFkK2yBfM0dMd9An2sGE/edit#gid=1317478762).

## Principles

### Customer-facing work

To work best with strategic customers, I:

1. Move fast and build momentum within large organizations
1. Create and maintain a reputation of dependable partnership and delivery
1. Approach issues with recommendations and best practices, rather than a greenfield exploration point of view

### Operating within the engineering org

To work best with the teams and product stakeholders also involved in this work, I:

1. Partner closely with the product stakholders on prioritizing team roadmaps â€“Â I will not "go around" a product manager stakeholder and make direct requests of another team's engineers
1. Focus on surfacing tactical information that empowers our engineering teams, like timelines, specific customer details, and customer sentiment

## Process

1. [Weekly product engineering sync meeting](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MGUwaG5tMnE5a25sbW51dXEyamJ2NW45c3Ugam9lbEBzb3VyY2VncmFwaC5jb20&tmsrc=joel%40sourcegraph.com) for product stakeholders. We use this to stay closely aligned in priorities and roadmaps.
1. #cp-strategic for updates
1. Ad-hoc meetings with sales and customer engineering stakeholders

### CE Customer Issue Routing

Customer Engineers often receive issues from strategic customers and the introduction of this cross-functional project makes it unclear where to post these issues. Please follow the below process when you receive an issue...

1. File a product gap in Salesforce
1. Notify the respective slack channel
   1. If the issue is within a single team with clear ownership, post within that team's channel and cross-post in [#cp-strategic](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C03MW9T8G6A) for FYI
   1. If the issue is within multiple teams or ownership is unclear, post in [#cp-strategic](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C03MW9T8G6A)
