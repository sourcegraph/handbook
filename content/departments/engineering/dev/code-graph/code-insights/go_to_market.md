### How to demo Code Insights on public prospect repos

If you want to run Code Insights over a public prospect's repo, [follow these steps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fOrEPLS91-4CTNwihOQi7w0Q_nOIEd0X/view?usp=sharing) to connect those repos to demo.sourcegraph.com. Since it's unlikely you're a site admin on demo.sourcegraph.com, you can tag @ce-sdr-collab in the #CE channel to ask them to temporarily connect the repos you need. Note: you should ensure you use **demo.sourcegraph.com** and **not** sourcegraph.com
