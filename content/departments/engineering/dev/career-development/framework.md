# Sourcegraph engineering career development framework

Our career development framework is here to help you understand the expectations of your role, and to provide a common language for you and your manager to discuss and plan your career growth. It is also an important part of our larger goal of ensuring everyone is equitably recognized for the impact they have at work, and to reduce bias in promotions and hiring.

## What are the expectations of my role?

We have shared expectations for all engineers, regardless of level or role. On top of that we have additional levels showing how a teammate’s impact, scope, execution, and teamwork varies by level.

- Impact: The tangible and positive difference made through one's contributions to the company’s mission.
- Scope: The breadth and depth of one’s technical and non-technical expertise, including how one maps business goals to technical solutions.
- Execution: The ability to consistently and efficiently translate plans into outcomes.
- Teamwork: The art of collaborating effectively with others, both within and outside the organization.

Expectations for a level add to the expectations of earlier levels. In addition, we expect engineers at all levels to exhibit our values.

We expect every engineer to eventually reach at least level 3. It is the responsibility of your manager to track this, and to ensure that you are given the support and opportunities needed for career growth.

## Successful engineers at Sourcegraph

In order to make the level descriptions below a bit more tangible, we also have the following document: [Successful engineers at Sourcegraph](./successful-engineers.md).

## When do I get promoted?

You are eligible for promotion when your manager can demonstrate that you’ve had at least one quarter of high performance at your current level and at least one quarter consistently performing at the next level. This includes having demonstrated impact consistent with the next level. Technical growth alone is not sufficient for promotion. See our documentation on impact reviews for more about the promotion and compensation process.

## All Levels

  - Identifies, proposes, and implements solutions to fill the gaps between engineering efforts and goals.

- Teamwork:
  - Influences the direction of the engineering organization.
  - Uplifts entire teams. Actively shapes the engineering team’s culture.
  - Helps others understand the company direction, detects misalignments, and provides missing context.

## IC5

- Impact: Drives and delivers top-level company initiatives with only broad strategic guidance.

- Scope:

  - Applies technical expertise to the company’s most challenging problems.
