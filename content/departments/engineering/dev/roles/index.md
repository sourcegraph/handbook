## Engineering Manager

Engineering managers lead, grow, and develop teams of software engineers.

### Responsibilities

- Facilitate and sustain a healthy, inclusive team culture where everyone is set up to do their best work (examples: [retrospectives](../../../../company-info-and-process/communication/retrospectives.md), [team events](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel/index.md#team-events)).
- Model, teach, and apply [our values](../../../../company-info-and-process/values/index.md) and [our guiding engineering principles](../process/principles-and-practices.md).
- Ensure the team has clear incremental goals that are documented and are always up-to-date (example: [PM – EM partnership responsibilities](../../../product/roles/product_manager_engineering_manager_responsibilities.md)).
- Regularly communicate the team's progress toward their goals as well as changes in team goals to appropriate stakeholders (examples: presenting a slide at [company meeting](../../../../company-info-and-process/communication/company_meeting.md), sending [status updates](../tools/engineering-management.md#status-updates))
