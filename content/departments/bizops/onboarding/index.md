# BizOps onboarding

Welcome! We're so excited to have you join the BizOps team. This document outlines the structure of your first few weeks at Sourcegraph. Most of the actual onboarding content is in Process Street, so to avoid duplication some sections are intentionally non-specific.

## Week 1

#### Get set up

#### Understand company and team mission, values and goals

- [Sourcegraph values](../../../company-info-and-process/values/index.md)
- [Sourcegraph strategy](../../../strategy-goals/strategy/index.md)
- [Sourcegraph OKRs](../../../strategy-goals/goals/index.md)
- [Current BizOps projects](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/224/views/1) and [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/63)

#### Understand Sourcegraph communication and documentation standards

#### Onboarding sessions

Your manager will help you schedule the following training sessions:

- Review the [sales onboarding quiz](../../sales/onboarding/quiz.md)
- Check out the [Dev Pain Sessions](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/167Umyjs25fHPonju2ctWhtrkADDQ1WSJ) in the Know Thy Dev sales enablement program for a deep dive into how Sourcegraph solves common developer pains. These videos are long so we recommend skipping to the parts the CEs are demoing and listening at at >1x speed
- Data overview (led by DataOps)
  - Product data
    - Frontend data capture, Amplitude and their data pipelines
    - Pings: what is it and their data pipelines
  - Sales and marketing data overview
    - HubSpot and Salesforce data architecture overview
    - Enhancing sales and marketing data with Polytomic

#### Get to know fellow teammates

## Weeks 2 and 3

- Your manager and you will work together to find good onboarding projects that combine your areas of interest with real problems we need to solve. These projects should include the following elements:
  - Familiarize you with our tech stack (HubSpot/Salesforce for customer ops roles and BigQuery/Looker for product ops roles)
  - Reinforce our product's value propositions
  - Include collaboration with another team to start building familiarity with how other teams operate
  - Be opportunities for you to get a quick win or two
- Continue asking questions about Sourcegraph (the company and product) and reinforcing our values and goals.
- Look back at your onboarding material from week 1. It's a lot of new information, but it will become second nature over time with a little bit of repetition!
- Think about how onboarding could be improved for the next person and make changes to it along the way. It will never be perfect, but it can always get better!

## Week 4

- Get onboarded onto your first big project!
- Month one check-in
