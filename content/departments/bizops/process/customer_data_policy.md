## FAQs

### Where is my data stored?

All outside tools listed above are cloud products and therefore the data is hosted by the service provider. All product data and any internally-built tools are stored in the Postgres database that hosts Sourcegraph Cloud, as well as data pipelines and warehouses in Google Cloud Platform.

### Can Sourcegraph developers or admins see my private code?

No. Only you can see or edit your private code. Code host permissions are enforced and not even Sourcegraph’s admin accounts can see private code. Manage your permissions in the code host and they will be automatically replicated in Sourcegraph.

### Can Sourcegraph developers or admins see my private settings and Sourcegraph configuration?

No. Only you can see or edit your private settings and Sourcegraph configuration.

### Is my data encrypted?

Yes, our dedicated security team follows best-practices for data encryption, both at-rest and in-transit. The following documents outline our practices in details:

- [Security Policy](https://about.sourcegraph.com/security/)
- [Privacy Policy](https://about.sourcegraph.com/privacy/)
- [Terms of Service](https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-dotcom)

If you have further questions, reach out to us at [security@sourcegraph.com](mailto:security@sourcegraph.com).

### What is my private data used for?

Your in-product data (e.g. your user settings) are used to deliver you the product. This data is not accessible by most Sourcegraph teammates (see 'Can you see my private code?'). All other non-sensitive, personally identifiable information and product usage data is used to support our teams in delivering and improving Sourcegraph for you and your team.
