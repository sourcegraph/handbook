# Business Operations & Strategy

The Business Operations & Strategy (BizOps) team operates with the mission of driving scalable growth through cross-functional internal projects that expedite progress towards company goals.

This page is a WIP. Among things it will cover:

- Project intake and prioritization (e.g. getting exec sponsorship)
- What we do vs. don't do (with example projects)
- more specific vision, mission, short-term and long-term goals
