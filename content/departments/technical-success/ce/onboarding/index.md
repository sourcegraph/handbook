# Customer Engineering Onboarding

Welcome to Sourcegraph—we're VERY excited to have you on the Customer Engineering team! This page describes the onboarding philosophy and process for new customer engineers as they onboarding, and outlines expectations and [goals of onboarding](#high-level-onboarding-overview) as well as what success looks like [30 / 60 / 90](#30-60-90-day-plan) days in.

## Company-wide and Customer Engineering-specific Onboarding

Our goal is to have CEs fully ramped by the end of your 6th week. During your first 6 weeks, you will complete a variety of activities intended to both introduce you to the company as a whole, as well as provide you with the knowledge, tools, and support necessary to be a successful CE!

### Onboarding Tooling

As a company, we use [Process.st](https://app.process.st/reports/) to guide each individuals' onboarding. Your own custom onboarding plan will be provided to you prior to your first day and will serve as your guide.

### Onboarding Support

Each new CE is paired with two individuals during their onboarding time: an onboarding buddy and an onboarding mentor. Your onboarding buddy is assigned as part of our company-wide onboarding program. For the CE team, this will be a peer from an adjacent team with whom you'll work closely. Your onboarding mentor will be someone from the CE team with whom you'll have regular check-ins and will be there to help guide you. Both of these assignments will be indicated in your Process.st checklist.

You can read more about Onboarding Mentors [here] and about CE mentors [here](ce-onboarding-mentor.md).

## High-level Onboarding Overview

Below are the goals and expectations for each week of your onboarding.

### Week 1 Goals:

- Complete through General Company-Wide Onboarding activities: our values, our vision, our culture, what it means to be handbook-first, and how we operate as a business
- Get all necessary access to tools and logistical setup
- Learn about our purpose and the value we provide to customers: why does Sourcegraph exist, who uses our product, and how do we add value to our customers' business
- Learn about the CE org: who are we, who do we work with, what's our vision and why what we do matters

### Week 2 Goals:

- Continue orienting yourself to the company: all the different teams, our internal tooling and how we use it
- Start to learn our processes (pre and post-sales), learn about the different templates that we have and how we use them

### Week 3 Goals:

- This week is all about the product! Read docs, watch videos, apply what you have learned by using the product, deep dive into parts of the product to your onboarding mentor

### Week 4 Goals:

- Learn about how we differentiate from technologies like GitHub Search, Livegrep, OpenGrok and more

- Check-in with your manager on your experience and near-term goals

As soon as you're demo certified, you'll lead your first customer meeting. You'll work closely with your onboarding mentor and manager to receive your [Demo Certification](#ce-demo-certification).

## 30 / 60 / 90 Day Plan

We want every CE to feel certain and comfortable with where they are at currently, what's expected of them, and what's next. During your first 90 days, this is what success looks like.

## CE Demo Certification

Each CE is expected to receive demo certification _before_ being allowed to lead their first customer demo. Certification means passing against [this rubric scoring guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qZ4ctMFcjzDN8fdfKXO3_LcLjRb6UHG6WOWGEbrMmLE/edit).

As onboarding progresses to around weeks 4 and 5, a new CE should begin practicing their use-case based demo scripts with their mentor and manager 1:1. When a CE and their mentor feel they have progressed enough in demo practice, the onboarding CE should schedule a demo review with their mentor and manager for agreed approval that the onboarding CE can lead customer calls. From this point of approval, an onboarding CE is ready to lead a customer demo.

For final demo certification, a [rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sS9asPWG0Dm-mNKtoum1TRTyiPLsb98i-_g4ZNDbGHg/edit#gid=0) will be used to assess a new CE’s demo competency.
