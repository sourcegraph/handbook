# CE Career Development Framework

Our career development framework is here to help you understand the expectations of your role, and to provide a common language for you and your manager to discuss and plan your career growth. It is also an important part of our larger goal of ensuring everyone is equitably recognized for the impact they have at work, and to reduce bias in promotions and hiring.

## What are the expectations of my role?

The CE team is a single globally distributed team. There are currently six levels for customers engineers at Sourcegraph. A level is composed of three categories (or core competencies), each with a summary statement and several example behaviors. These core competencies are:

- Leadership
- Business
- Technology

We think of these three core competencies that every CE must demonstrate in order to serve our customers and our business: leadership, business, and technology. Within each pillared competency are defined core behaviors that CEs perform. In most cases, a level builds on the expectations from the preceding levels, eg someone at level 2 must also meet the level 1 expectations. In addition to what is listed in our ladders (stored in Lattice, as well as shown below), we expect every customer engineer, at all levels, to exhibit our values. Also, rather than precede each bullet point with "consistently", we leave it as implicit. These are the expectations for ICs after they have completed their onboarding.

### Leadership

The leadership pillar embodies both the external and internal interpersonal relationships we build and nurture, the way in which we lead customers to value, and how we drive more value and better ways of doing business.

Within the leadership pillar there exists two core responsibility areas:

- Relationship Management:The application of interpersonal skills required to appropriately manage and nurture relationships; navigating business and / or political considerations.
- Outcomes: The activities that CEs perform to lead prospective customers to intended and desired outcomes.

### Business

The business pillar embodies the way in which we come to know and understand our customers’ business and their needs. It also includes how our business serves these needs.

Within the business pillar there exists two core responsibility areas:

- Contextual Understanding: The ability to learn various internal and external roles & responsibilities and nurture them uniquely.
- Operational Excellence: The ability to perform job responsibilities and abide by all team and company processes and procedures.

### Technology

The technology pillar embodies the skills necessary to solve customer problems.

Within the technology pillar there exists two core responsibility areas:

- Sourcegraph Product: The ability to learn about our product capabilities and limitations; apply that knowledge to help customers; extend the boundaries of our capabilities; serve as a voice of the customer back to internal teams.
- Solving Technical Problems: The expected technical understanding and skillset required in order to deliver value and solutions to prospective customers.

## When do I get promoted?

See guidance on promotions [here](../../../people-talent/people-ops/process/teammate-sentiment/impact-reviews/#promotion-philosophy).

## CE Regional Team Leads

Team Leads are specially designated senior ICs that are elevated within the team to take on additional responsibilities in support of the overall success of the team and individuals. These individuals are not full-time managers but are intentionally given less IC scope than their peers so that they can contribute to higher level initiatives within the team and organization.

As a Team Lead, their scope and responsibility, in addition to the expectations of their defined IC level, includes:

- Ownership: responsible for team member adherence to team processes; facilitates and leads inspection of such processes for their team. Participates in intra- and inter-team projects as a leader. Represents the organization in select cross-functional initiatives. Represents technical needs and risks of teams’ book of business in forecast calls.
- Coordination: coordinates with team members and leadership on ad-hoc requests, process changes, and needs. Coordinates with adjacent teams and leaders on behalf of team needs.
- Support: directly supports team members day-to-day providing active coaching and mentorship on technical delivery.
- Adjusts: listens to feedback from team members and adjacent teams getting to root cause of issues and identifies solutions and go-forward plans; guides the team through change.

## CEs Transitioning to CE Management

We want to support the career progession of CEs on the Customer Engineering team based on their individual career goals and aspirations. For those that desire to move from an individual contributor (IC) role to a management role, the CE Manager Interview Process for Internal CE Candidates outlines how teammates would go about assessing their readiness for and applying for new CE Manager roles that open up. The goal of this process is provide clear visibility into what expectations should be for career advancement into management within the CE team.

Learn more about CEs transitioning to CE management [here](cemgr-candidates-internal.md).
