# GTM Backlog Prioritization

Our customer's voices need to be heard and need to be reflected in the Product and Engineering decisions that we make. In an effort to bring this to the forefront, we will use the following process to identify the highest priorities of our customers as they pertain to our internal initiatives and strategic goals, and ensure that these priorities are then weighted in overall product roadmap and Job Fair decision making. This process is the responsibility of the go-to-market teams. In particular, account teams should feel accountable for bringing any and all product feedback forward and ensuring this feedback is accurately represented and conveyed.

### Process

1. <b>Product Gaps</b> - CEs/TAs, in conjunction with their partner AEs, identify product gaps and feature requests from their customers. These gaps should then be indicated as Salesforce Product Gaps using the [standard Product Gap submission process](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/engineering/product/process/feedback/surfacing_product_feedback/). This should be done, as accurately as possible, for <em>every</em> currently unsupported feature that your customers are interested in and could impact our ability to sell to and expand with them. Submitted Product Gaps will continue to be reviewed by the Product teams, added to backlogs, and kept up to date by the responsible members of Product and Engineering.
2. <b>Analysis</b> - The data produced by the Product Gaps submissions are reviewed, primarily using the Salesforce dashboards and reports found [here](https://sourcegraph2020.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Dashboard/01Z5b0000004tnMEAQ/view?queryScope=userFolders) and [here](https://sourcegraph2020.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Dashboard/01Z5b0000015UGhEAM/view?queryScope=userFolders). The following metrics are the primary contributors to Product Gap priority. Gaps that rank highly among all of these individual metrics are the ranked highest overally.
    - Impacted ARR - What is the total impact to ARR of the Salesforce Opps affected by the Product Gap? What is the impacted TAM of impacted accounts?
    - Number of Impacted Accounts - How many accounts have indicated the desire for the Product Gap to be resolved?
    - Impact on Strategic Accounts - Are Strategic Accounts impacted by the Product? What is the extent of this Strategic impact?
    - Product Gap Priority - Are a significant number of impacted accounts indicating the gap as P0, suggesting that the opp will fall through unless the gap is resolved?
