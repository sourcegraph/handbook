# GTM Backlog Prioritization

Our customer's voices need to be heard and need to be reflected in the Product and Engineering decisions that we make. In an effort to bring this to the forefront, we will use the following process to identify the highest priorities of our customers as they pertain to our internal initiatives and strategic goals, and ensure that these priorities are then weighted in overall product roadmap and Job Fair decision making. This process is the responsibility of the go-to-market teams. In particular, account teams should feel accountable for bringing any and all product feedback forward and ensuring this feedback is accurately represented and conveyed.

### Process

1. <b>Product Gaps</b> - CEs/TAs, in conjunction with their partner AEs, identify product gaps and feature requests from their customers. These gaps should then be indicated as Salesforce Product Gaps using the [standard Product Gap submission process](../../..//engineering/product/process/feedback/surfacing_product_feedback/). This should be done, as accurately as possible, for <em>every</em> currently unsupported feature that your customers are interested in and could impact our ability to sell to and expand with them. Submitted Product Gaps will continue to be reviewed by the Product teams, added to backlogs, and kept up to date by the responsible members of Product and Engineering.
2. <b>Analysis</b> - The data produced by the Product Gaps submissions are reviewed, primarily using the Salesforce dashboards and reports found [here](https://sourcegraph2020.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Dashboard/01Z5b0000004tnMEAQ/view?queryScope=userFolders) and [here](https://sourcegraph2020.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Dashboard/01Z5b0000015UGhEAM/view?queryScope=userFolders). This analysis should result in a 'Top 10' list of the most important GTM Product Gaps created by the GTM TPM (currently Andrew Norrish). The following metrics are the primary contributors to Product Gap priority. Gaps that rank highly among all of these individual metrics are the ranked highest overally.
   - Impacted ARR - What is the total impact to ARR of the Salesforce Opps affected by the Product Gap? What is the impacted TAM of impacted accounts?
   - Number of Impacted Accounts - How many accounts have indicated the desire for the Product Gap to be resolved?
   - Impact on Strategic Accounts - Are Strategic Accounts impacted by the Product? What is the extent of this Strategic impact?
   - Product Gap Priority - Are a significant number of impacted accounts indicating the gap as P0, suggesting that the opp will fall through unless the gap is resolved?
3. <b>Alignment</b> - Following the creation of the GTM 'Top 10' Product Gaps list, the list is reviewed with Product and Engineering against the currently roadmap and Job Fair projects. In the overall greenlighting process for Job Fair, projects that resolve Product Gaps in the 'Top 10' list will be heavily weighted.
4. <b>Resolution</b> - Once on the overall Job Fair board and Product Roadmap, resolution of the Product Gaps will follow standard engineering processes. After being resolved and released, the resoponsible Proiduct/Engineering members will update the resolved Product Gaps, and the next highest priority Product Gap will take it's place in the GTM 'Top 10' Product Gap list.

### FAQ

#### Why do we use Product Gaps when all of the Engineering work is done in GitHub? Feels lke double-documentation that can get out of sync.
Product Gaps are pivotal to us collecting account, opportunity, and revenue information that can't be found in GitHub. Ultimately, it is the Engineering TPM's responsibility for managing Product Gaps after they're created, making sure they are accurately up-to-date-, and ensuring there is linking between the Product Gaps and their associated GitHub Issues. This will provide improved visibility into the status of each Product Gap's resolution, while allowing for continued analysis of impacted customers and revenue. If you have issues with Product Gaps that you want addressed, feel free to drop that feedback in #wg-backlog-prioritization.

Note - We are actively looking into cleaning up any existing inaccuracies in Product Gaps so you can move forward feeling confident in the documentation.

#### What happens to Product Gaps that aren't selected for the GTM 'Top 10' List?
Product Gaps not selected as the highest current GTM priority will still be reviewed by PMs and added to the backlog. Being selected for the 'Top 10' list simply conveys the priority to Product and Engineering, greatly increases the likelyhood of that project being selected and the urgency with which those projects will be addressed. Also, the 'Top 10' list is fluid as Product Gaps are addressed, so gaps that aren't currently list may be on the list in the future.

#### I have concerns with the current 'Top 10' list. What do I do?
Please provide that feedback in #wg-backlog-prioritization and tag the GTM TPM (Andrew Norrish).
