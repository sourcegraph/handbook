# Customer Engineering (CE)

## Who we are

Customer Engineering at Sourcegraph is responsible for the pre-sales technical success of prospective dev users. We serve as the product experts during the sales cycle, leading technical discovery, product demonstrations, technical solutioning, and trials for new prospects and new opportunities within existing customers.

## Our Team Purpose Statement

Building trusted relationships with prospective dev users by aligning our solutions to their needs to accelerate their business

## Team KPIs / Measures of Success

The three primary team KPIs for CE are:

- New Annual Contract Value (New ACV)
- Technical Closure of Trials
- Trial Cycle Time

## Team Expectations
- Technically qualify the opportunity and tech requirements
- Scope out and plan the trial while trying to influence in our favor
- Lead the actual trial execution with the customer / prospect
- Report out on the results tied to value not just usage

### New ACV

As the pre-sales technical experts, CEs play an integral role in closing new business that leads to new incremental revenue for Sourcegraph, whether a new customer or an expansion within an existing customer. This dimension looks at the number of new customers acquired, net number of opportunities successfully closed (both net new customers and expansions), and number of products sold whether on a net new prospect or within a new team at an existing customer.

### Technical Closure of Trials

During the sales cycle CE's typically lead a customer through a technical validation (trials). A primary measure of success is the technical closure of a trial, which we refer to as "achieving the technical win". Achieving the technical win means that the prospective buyer agrees that our solution and capabilities meets their technical requirements and expectations.

For any deal that enters Stage 4 (technical & business validation), we expect the CE to lead the customer through a successful technical validation based on their stated needs and evaluation criteria regardless of outcome of the overall opportunity. Our target is 80%.

### Trial Cycle Time

This looks at the efficiency and duration of the technical evaluation (trial) itself. The technical evaluation happens during Stage 4 of the sales cycle. Our goal is to complete a complex trial within 30 days, and complete the majority of standard trials within 21 days.
