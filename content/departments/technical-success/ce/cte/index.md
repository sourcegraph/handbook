# Customer Training Engineers

_For FY23 roadmap and goals, see [our roadmap](roadmap.md)._

## Who we are

Customer Training Engineers (CTE), within Customer Engineering (CE), have been specialized experts focused first and foremost on customer training and enablement. Our team will define, build, and maintain all aspects of external training, starting with our Enterprise customers first. This includes the definition (and continued iteration) of the strategy and standardization of our customer-facing training methodology and curriculum to support that strategy.

As an extension of the way we train and enable users, this team will secondarily focus on internal training and enablement of Customer Engineers in support of our customersâ€™ experience. We will train our CEs on how to provide customers with consistent, relevant, repeatable, and timely training and enablement materials (train the trainers) that increase use-case adoption and enables admins and end-users, in addition to occasionally hosting webinars and training sessions ourselves. In time, we expect dedicated Trainers to conduct Enterprise customer training.

This team and their responsibilities are being folded into the broader post-sales Technical Advisory team effect Oct 2022 and beyond.
