# Implementation Engineering (IE)

## Who we are

The Implementation Engineering (IE) team at Sourcegraph reduces time to value for our customers by providing expertise and hands-on service to deploy, install, and configure Sourcegraph within customer environments (self-hosted). IEs work front and center directly with customers, in collaboration with internal teams, to lead the implementation effort. IEs are supported by an Implementation Project Manager who oversees the internal and external tasks, needs, and dependencies across these implementations, and also handles internal and external reporting.

IEs work in support of Strategic customers as they install their Production environments. Specifically, IEs assist with multi-node deployments like Kubernetes (with or without Helm). Prior to the Production design being finalized, an IE will be introduced to the customer and work with them to validate their Production design. As part of this validation process, the IE will build a replica environment to confirm the design decisions. Once confirmed, the IE will either be provisioned access to the customers' environment in order to perform the deployment installation and setup, or will work closely with the customer in an advisory role to guide them.

## Our Team Purpose Statement

Optimizing time to value by providing an exceptional product delivery experience through technical excellence

## Team KPIs / Measures of Success

Our primary measure of success is the time (duration) it takes to install, setup, and configure a production environment for our customers. Our ideal state is for our customers, even in the most complex of situations, to have a working production instance within 30 days.
