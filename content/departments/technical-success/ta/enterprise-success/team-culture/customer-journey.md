# Post-Sales Customer Journey

A TA, being a post-sales technical success manager, works with customers in a number of different ways throughout the customer journey. This page captures high-level descriptions of the ways in which we work with and on behalf of our customers. Our customer lifecycle is set and maintained through the Customer Lifecycle Stages playbook in Vitally.

Our customer lifecycle is set and maintained through the Customer Lifecycle Stages playbook in Vitally.

## Overview

Our customer lifecycle is comprised of the following stages:

- `0. Prospect` - a late-stage new business prospect that is 45- days out from closing. During this phase, CE is handing off and transferring knowledge to TA, if IE will be helping with the production deployment they will begin planning for that, the TA is preparing for partnership kick-off.
- `1. Onboarding` - when the deal closes, the account enters the [onboarding phase](#user-onboarding) of the lifecycle. Customers remain in this phase for the first 60 days of the partnership. During this time, the team is focused on ensuring their production instance is complete and onboarding end users. The goal is to get to 50% [Monthly Active Use / Total Seats Purchased](../../enterprise-success/index.md#utilization-adoption) by the end of the first 60 days.
- `2. Adopting` - after the initial onboarding phase, the account enters the [adoption](#adoption) phase. The focus in this phase is on driving greater usage and engagement with the product. The team works with the customer to identify and implement best practices & enable on use cases that drive greater adoption and daily use. Customers remain in this phase until they hit our usage targets of 30% [Daily Active Use / Monthly Active Use](../../enterprise-success/index.md#consumption-usage) and 80% Monthly Active Use / Total Seats Purchased.
- `3. Nurturing` - once the customer hits their adoption _and_ usage targets, they enter the [nurturing phase](#nurture). The focus in this phase shifts to maximizing the value the customer is getting from Sourcegraph. This includes identifying and implementing advanced product features, custom integrations, or new use cases. At this point in the journey we want to also be looking for co-marketing opportunities.
- `4. Renewing` - 120 days out from contract renewal, the account transitions into the renewing phase. The team focuses on ensuring the customer remains happy with the product and we are well-positioned for a strong renewal. The [renewal process](#renewal) kicks off to facilitate the renewal.

## User Onboarding

A critical part of the customer experience is user onboarding. After the deal close, and once the customers' production infrastructure is setup and configured, TAs are responsible for driving adoption of users onto Sourcegraph. During this phase, the TA is executing a user roll out plan to onboard the users onto Sourcegraph.

## Adoption

We have a 6-prong approach to developer enablement so that are able to meet each customer and each dev culture where they are. You can see an overview of our methods below:

For synchronous webinars, a standard customer engagement should include three core trainings, as well as optional topics customized to customer needs or requests, or demos of new features or use cases that are relevant to the team. These webinars may be run repeatedly if, for example, you're expanding into a new business unit within an existing customer.

### Standard trainings

- [Sourcegraph 101](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer-training/tree/main/trainings/sourcegraph-101) ([Video training](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1emSuz6Q871OC2YOadcfkrUXfuopn6JCB/view?usp=sharing)) - The basic "how to use Sourcegraph search" webinar. This should take a new users from 0 to able to use the tool competently. The repo includes a fully scripted talk track, a lesson plan version of the talk track for those who prefer that format to a script, a Slack follow up message to send to customers, test exercises for customers to run, and the content formatted for inclusion in a customer's LMS for self-directed learning.
- [Sourcegraph 102](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer-training/tree/main/trainings/sourcegraph-102) ([Video training](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1813s6MTmFqtWJ5IYVc6ivkX3mKlY6X7T/view?usp=sharing)) - This should take a customer from being a general Sourcegraph user through being able to use the majority of Sourcegraph's advanced search features.
- [Admin training webinar](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer-training/tree/main/trainings/admin-webinar) - This should take an admin for the instance through all of the elements of the admin area of the app, and leave them feeling confident with instance and user management training. This is not intended for cluster admins, and so does not cover sizing the cluster, etc.

## Nurture

The focus in this phase shifts to maximizing the value the customer is getting from Sourcegraph. This includes identifying and implementing advanced product features, custom integrations, or new use cases. At this point in the journey we want to also be looking for co-marketing opportunities.

## Renewal

Our renewal process begins 120 days prior to renewal. The activities performed during this stage of the customer journey is defined [here](processes.md#renewal-process).
