# TA Manager Interview Process for Internal Candidates

The guidelines here are based on Sourcegraph’s [existing guidelines around our internal transfer process](../../../../../company-info-and-process/working-at-sourcegraph/switching-teams.md) with additional requirements specific to the Customer Engineering & Support organization.

## Role Transfer/Promotion Requirements for Internal Candidates

1. Approval from the candidate’s direct manager on performance and values alignment. This should include at least 2 consecutive quarters (6 months minimum) of proven demonstration of performance at current level in current role.
1. While Sourcegraph is an [all-remote company](../../../../../company-info-and-process/remote/index.md#all-remote), it’s important that, due to the customer-facing nature of the team, the manager’s availability aligns with the teammates they manage. As such, internal candidates for management roles will need to have appropriate geographic alignment to be considered for a position.
1. Manager roles are either M3 or M4 level roles. Based on Sourcegraph compensation and leveling guidelines, only individuals at the IC3 or higher level are eligible to interview for an M3 or M4 position.
1. Any exception to these requirements will be on a ‘needs of the business’ basis and require VP approval before interviewing.

## Interview Process for Internal Candidates

All candidates (internal or external) will need to complete the same set of interviews for open manager roles. This provides for fairness and consistency for all candidates. As internal candidates have already completed the Sourcegraph Values Interview, they will be granted an exception and not need to complete that step a second time.

### [Hiring Manager Interview](../../../../people-talent/talent/process/types_of_interviews.md#hiring-manager-screen)

- This interview will be with the hiring manager.
- For internal candidates who do not have formal management experience, the focus will be on relevant experience they have had as a peer, heading a project or working on rolling out initiatives within a team or organization. The candidate will also be asked to respond as to what their approach might be in certain situations, not on actual experience in those situations.
- Major areas of focus: management style, building relationships with direct reports, and post-sales experience.

### [Cross Functional Leader Interview](../../../../people-talent/talent/process/types_of_interviews.md#cross-functional-collaboration-with-a-peer)

- This interview focuses on your ability to build and maintain strong relationships cross-functionally, how to communicate, manage change and overcome challenges between and among teams, and how to jointly manage the business.
- Major areas of focus: building relationships, process and alignment with other teams, and communicating and handling escalations between teams.

### [Sourcegraph Values Interview](../../../../people-talent/talent/process/evaluating_values.md)

- Not applicable for internal candidates.
