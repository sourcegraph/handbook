# TA Career Development Framework

This is a WIP.

### Transitioning to TA Management

We want to support the career progression of individuals based on their individual career goals and aspirations. For those that desire to move from an individual contributor (IC) role to a management role, the TA Manager Interview Process for Internal TA Candidates outlines how teammates would go about assessing their readiness for and applying for new TA Manager roles that open up. The goal of this process is provide clear visibility into what expectations should be for career advancement into management within the TA team.
