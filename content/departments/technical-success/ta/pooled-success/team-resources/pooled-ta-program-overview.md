# Pooled TA Program Overview

The Pooled TA program inherits and reuses most of the digital nurture practices from the [Digital Success](../../digital-success/index.md) team while running a streamlined version of the playbooks and processes of the [Enterprise & Strategic TA team](../../enterprise-success/index.md). This hybrid approach allows the Pooled TA team to focus on our Mid-Market and Enterprise segments' unique needs through a low-touch experience that relies heavily on automated tooling.

### Prospect

- Trials are only for Cloud-hosted instances. Free or paid.
- Production license creation and management: CE.
- Production cloud instance creation: CE.
- Account user/role mapping: CE.
- CE to TA handoff: CE driven.
- AE introduces the customer to the Technical Advisory team.

### Onboarding

#### Partnership kickoff

A 30-minute call with the customer Stakeholders, Admin and Program Manager with the following agenda:

- Reconfirm the customer's business goals and value drivers.
- Review contract terms and features.
- Confirm and map customer contacts (admins, program owners, stakeholders).
- Digital end-user onboarding program.
- Success metrics & engagement cadence.

#### Digital campaigns

- Run for 60 days from contract close.
- Pooled customers are required to be on the cloud. The production instance is assumed to be provisioned as part of the handoff process.
- Customer onboarding consists of digitally nurtured email campaigns to customer contacts.

#### Admin onboarding

- This email sequence is sent to anyone tagged as an Instance Admin on the account.
- These materials provide help tips for configuring and maintaining the production instance.

#### End user onboarding

- Once we collect the first ping from an instance, an end-user onboarding email is sent to anyone tagged as a Program Contact on the account.
- These materials are intended to be shared with end users to help them onboard to Sourcegraph.
- We also offer the program contact an opportunity to respond and request help from our team.
- Depending on the contract entitlements, we have different sequences for Code Search only, Cody only, or Code Search and Cody.

#### Onboarding check-in

A 30-day check-in and survey email is sent to the Program Contact, Instance Admin, and Champion of an account. Our goal with this check-in is to:

1. Allow customers to provide feedback on their experience.
2. Request help from the TA team as desired.

### Adopting

- Customers enter the adoption phase after 60 days.
- Customers remain in the adoption before they surpass 80% utilization (MAU/Seats) AND 30% usage (DAU/MAU).
- The Pooled team will sync twice yearly with the customer using a mutual Account Success Plan (ASP) to ensure the customer is on track to meet their business goals.
- We'll send new product features and beta program announcements to keep our customers up-to-date.
- Conduct product roadmap reviews and product feedback sessions with customers twice a year.

#### Digital campaigns

- 90-day check-in:
  - 90 days into the relationship, the customer Program Contact, Champion, and Instance Admin receive their first Usage Recap Email summarizing highlights in usage across their account.
  - We offer Pooled TA team call availability for 30-minute calls to address questions and any outstanding issues.
- Targeted Outreach:
  - The Pooled team consistently tracks customer usage across the customer journey.
  - We send customized enablement resources based on individual usage and adoption, ensuring our customers receive tailored support for optimal platform utilization.
- Poor or concerning health:
  - When customer health is poor or concerning, specific email campaigns are sent to encourage enablement and use.

### Nurturing

- Customers enter the nurture phase once they have surpassed 80% utilization (MAU/Seats) AND 30% usage (DAU/MAU).
- The Pooled TA team will constantly monitor usage and adoption metrics to spot and flag opportunities to offer additional product features to customers.
- We will work with our commercial teams to capture and map customer use cases to product features biannually.
- The Pooled team will work with our customer stakeholders to plan and work on a Customer Business Review (CBR) to jointly capture the value realized with our platform for the scoped dev use cases.

#### Digital campaigns

Advanced enablement: When users interact with a new feature for the first time, the Pooled team is alerted, and advanced use case materials are sent to the customer to encourage enablement and use.

### Renewing

- A customer enters the Renewing lifecycle stage 120 days before renewal.
- This process is currently facilitated primarily by the Account Executive.
- The Pooled team will conduct a Renewal Health Assessment to scope the priorities and activities that will be executed 120 leading to the renewal.
- If any risk is identified, accounts will enter the [Lighthouse Program](../../enterprise-success/team-culture/processes/#sts=Lighthouse%20Program).
- The Pooled team will be available to jump on customer sync calls as needed.
