# Pooled Technical Advisors

## Who we are

Pooled Technical Advisors (TA) are technical experts not dedicated to any specific customer but rather the team services a set of customers, together. This allows us to deliver a consistent engagement experience to customers via flexibility to allocate teammates based on customer needs and teammate bandwidth and allocation. Customers may not necessarily interact with the same TA, though we'll strive to where possible. Pooled TAs are still rooted in providing value and helping customers achieve their desired positive business outcomes within their business using our platform and products. The Pooled TA team leverages much of our Digital programming to augment their work and activities. We are responsible for ensuring that customers achieve their success metrics and continue to find new valuable use cases for Sourcegraph.

## What is a Pooled TA at Sourcegraph?

Across the customer lifecycle, Pooled TAs are primarily accountable for the following:

- Customer onboarding & adoption: At contract signature, our Pooled TA team will receive the hand-off from Sales and Customer Engineering (pre-sales) and conduct a lightweight kick-off with the customer. Onboarding will consist primarily of digitally nurtured campaigns with oversight by the Pooled TA team and an ability to handle ad-hoc requests from the customer as needed.
- Achieving positive outcomes: we are successful when our customers are realizing the expected value and achieving positive outcomes that are additive to their devs and business. We do this by conducting bi-annual success planning and annual customer business reviews to ensure we're partnering together in support of their long-term success.
- Customer advocacy: throughout our partnership, TAs serve as steadfast advocates on behalf of our customers by raising their needs and desires to our Product teams and conduct bi-annual roadmap reviews and product feedback sessions with customers.

- ## Team KPIs / Measures of Success

We use the following metrics to gauge the effectiveness and success of our team:

- Utilization (Adoption)
- Consumption (Usage)
- Retention (Gross Retention)
- Growth (Net Retention)

### Utilization (Adoption)

We consider healthy adoption/utilization to comprise at least 80% consumption of purchased seats as measured by Monthly Active Users (MAU) / Total Licensed Seats. We aim to get to 80% consumption within the first 60 days of the engagement (after the production environment is established) and maintain at least 80% consumption at all times.

### Consumption (Usage)

TAs seek to educate and enable customer devs to integrate Sourcegraph into their workflows so that they use it multiple times daily. Today, we calculate usage based on a 4-week average lookback of daily active users / last month's monthly active users.

### Retention

We strive to make customers for life by being trusted partners and advisors to make our customers successful. We measure ourselves to this premise by ensuring our customers choose us repeatedly. Gross retention is a key metric for measuring our success.

### Growth

As technical advisors, we want to deeply know and understand our customers. It is through this lens of trust and understanding that we are able to strengthen our partnership and help our customers maturity and advance their capabilities. Net Retention is a key metric for measuring our ability to grow with our customers, unlocking more value and capabilities from Sourcegraph within their teams.
