# TA Processes

Processes exist to ensure consistent practices amongst teams. Processes that the TA team either drives or heavily contributes to are outlined below.

### Post-sales hand-off

This process occurs through both Salesforce and Vitally. Below is an overview of the process along with additional details about tooling automation that facilitates the process.

The pre-to-post sales handoff process consists of the following steps:

1. Technical Advisor Support Level is manually assigned on the Salesforce Account by TA leadership
2. The account is created in Vitally automatically once the Support Level is set
3. The Customer Segmentation Assignment Vitally Playbook runs to assign account segment attribute of: Strategic, Enterprise, Mid-Market, or SMB.
4. Digital Scaled customers are assigned an account segment attribute of: Scaled.
5. Customer Lifecycle Stages Vitally Playbook runs to assign account as "0. Prospect", the first step in the customer lifecycle. At this point, the account is created and all initial attributes about the new customer are assigned in Vitally.
6. TA leadership continues to monitor the new business opportunity until close.
7. Upon close, the pre-sales CE performs the following steps:
   1. Creates the production license
   2. If relevant, generates request for new cloud production instance.
   3. Completes [instance to admin mapping](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12W85VTKLJg2Os74PWADxwOPfpMozB0mUm4Do6fN9dFs/edit?usp=sharing)
   4. Tags customer contacts with the appropriate `role` on their contact card in Salesforce.

### How We Use Notion

Utilizing columns to represent different stages of the project lifecycle, such as "To-Do," "In Progress," "Under Review," and "Completed," we can easily track the status of each task. This visual representation enhances collaboration by providing a real-time overview of project progress, enabling quick identification of areas that require attention. This allows transparency and efficiency among team members.

### How we Use Vitally

#### Customer Utilization and Alerts

The Customer Utilization playbook enables us to internally notify our Digital Success Teams and Account Executives whenever customers engage with a feature for the first time. Additionally, it provides the capability to ensure that customers fully leverage the number of seats purchased. The playbooks automatically trigger alerts, notifying our team through #alerts-customer-usage channel.

#### Conversations

We monitor key metrics associated with our conversations to analyze and optimize our communication strategies. This includes tracking open and read rates, monitoring unsubscribes, and managing [pending](https://sourcegraph.vitally.io/hubs/335a99ea-5302-498d-9d11-cc39aa8386b9/d22fb1ab-179a-4a55-9b5b-e997a86ad5c4), [bounced](https://sourcegraph.vitally.io/hubs/335a99ea-5302-498d-9d11-cc39aa8386b9/0093fc1f-b3e9-4602-afd5-0ad46cd70f55) and [sent](https://sourcegraph.vitally.io/hubs/335a99ea-5302-498d-9d11-cc39aa8386b9/1e8f0f60-c8e8-4356-9ebf-2258dbdca5aa) conversations.

As part of this initiative, we've crafted a Health Overview dashboard, accessible through [Customer Health Overview](https://sourcegraph.vitally.io/hubs/335a99ea-5302-498d-9d11-cc39aa8386b9/fd3cafe5-94a0-4c7f-bbdb-aa40b34269b4), providing a centralized and insightful view of the health status of our Digital Success customers. This dashboard serves as a valuable tool, facilitating informed decision-making and fostering proactive engagement with our customer base.

## Digital Scaled Success churned customer playbook

### Notification

When a Sourcegraph customer in the Digital Scaled Success program churns, a notification of such is posted in #gtm-operations-review. Automation should be added to this message to look up and notify the appropriate team or assigned TA to successfully close out the churned customer.

In the case of a customer in Digital Scaled Success program, the team will receive an alert via the #gtm-operations-review channel.

### Customer Review & Steps Taken

Upon notification, the Digital Scaled Success team should check the following:

- Confirm Account Type on the Salesforce Account Record is marked as: (5) Attrited Customer.
  - This is important for removing the account from Vitally.
- Determine applicability for tearing down cloud instance
  - Check Vitally report for the Deployment Method field of the Account:
    - If Deployment Method is Sourcegraph Managed:
      - Confirm that the customer is a Sourcegraph Cloud customer listed on https://cloud-ops.sgdev.org/dashboard/environments/prod
      - In a public channel, ex. customer-X, notify the account team that you are about to submit a Cloud Teardown request.
      - Submit the Cloud Teardown request on GitHub.
      - Post in #discuss-cloud-ops with a link to the teardown request.
      - Note: it is critical that all teardown requests be created and shared promptly, since any delays can impact Sourcegraphâ€™s SOC-2 report and may harm the business.
- Confirm removal of slack channel, as required
  - Determine if an external and / or internal channel exists. If exists, communicate with the Account Executive to archive the relevant channels.
- Publish Post-Mortem
  - Collaborate with the account team in a public channel (ex. customer-X) on a Vitally doc that collects any names and emails of employees from the churning customer, calendar events, Chorus or Zoom recordings, and running notes documents. The goal of this document is to help Sourcegraph maintain or restart conversations with this company, in case they may become a customer again. Consider following the format of the Churn Retro Process described above.
  - Share the post-mortem document in the #gtm-operations-review channel with a brief summary [example](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C044K6JDBSM/p1705690088031729).
