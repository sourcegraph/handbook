### Post-sales hand-off

This process occurs through both Salesforce and Vitally. Below is an overview of the process along with additional details about tooling automation that facilitates the process.

The pre-to-post sales handoff process consists of the following steps:

1. Technical Advisor Support Level is manually assigned on the Salesforce Account by TA leadership
2. The account is created in Vitally automatically once the Support Level is set
3. The Customer Segmentation Assignment Vitally Playbook runs to assign account segment attribute of: Strategic, Enterprise, Mid-Market, or SMB.
4. Digital Scaled customers are assigned an account segment attribute of: Scaled.
5. Customer Lifecycle Stages Vitally Playbook runs to assign account as "0. Prospect", the first step in the customer lifecycle. At this point, the account is created and all initial attributes about the new customer are assigned in Vitally.
6. TA leadership continues to monitor the new business opportunity until close.
7. Upon close, the pre-sales CE performs the following steps:
   1. Creates the production license
   2. If relevant, generates request for new cloud production instance.
   3. Completes [instance to admin mapping](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12W85VTKLJg2Os74PWADxwOPfpMozB0mUm4Do6fN9dFs/edit?usp=sharing)
   4. Tags customer contacts with the appropriate `role` on their contact card in Salesforce.
