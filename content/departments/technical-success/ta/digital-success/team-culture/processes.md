# TA Processes

Processes exist to ensure consistent practices amongst teams. Processes that the TA team either drives or heavily contributes to are outlined below.

### Post-sales hand-off

This process occurs through both Salesforce and Vitally. Below is an overview of the process along with additional details about tooling automation that facilitates the process.

The pre-to-post sales handoff process consists of the following steps:

1. Technical Advisor Support Level is manually assigned on the Salesforce Account by TA leadership
2. The account is created in Vitally automatically once the Support Level is set
3. The Customer Segmentation Assignment Vitally Playbook runs to assign account segment attribute of: Strategic, Enterprise, Mid-Market, or SMB.
4. Digital Scaled customers are assigned an account segment attribute of: Scaled.
5. Customer Lifecycle Stages Vitally Playbook runs to assign account as "0. Prospect", the first step in the customer lifecycle. At this point, the account is created and all initial attributes about the new customer are assigned in Vitally.
6. TA leadership continues to monitor the new business opportunity until close.
7. Upon close, the pre-sales CE performs the following steps:
   1. Creates the production license
   2. If relevant, generates request for new cloud production instance.
   3. Completes [instance to admin mapping](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12W85VTKLJg2Os74PWADxwOPfpMozB0mUm4Do6fN9dFs/edit?usp=sharing)
   4. Tags customer contacts with the appropriate `role` on their contact card in Salesforce.

### How We Use Notion

Utilizing columns to represent different stages of the project lifecycle, such as "To-Do," "In Progress," "Under Review," and "Completed," we can easily track the status of each task. This visual representation enhances collaboration by providing a real-time overview of project progress, enabling quick identification of areas that require attention. This allows transparency and efficiency among team members.

### Vitally

#### Customer Playbooks

Playbooks in Vitally automate our process to reach our Digital Success customers effectively and efficiently.

#### Customer Utilization and Alerts

The Customer Utilization playbook allows us to internally alert our Digital Success Teams and Account Executives when customers have interacted with a feature for the 1st time, as well as the ability to ensure that customers fully utilize the number of seats purchased. The playbooks trigger the alerts to notify our team in #alerts-customer-usage.

#### Conversations

We monitor key metrics associated with our conversations. This includes tracking open and read rates, monitoring unsubscribes, and managing pending and bounced conversations. This allows us to analyze and optimize our communication strategies.

#### Customer Health

Focused customer health monitoring allows us to assess Digital Success customers' overall health and utilization by monitoring utilization, feature adoption, engagement of users, and version updates. This strategic approach enables us to proactively address any emerging concerns and fine-tune communication to meet the needs of our customers.
