# TA Cadences

## Daily

### Internal

  - Be a good teammate! Make sure to update your Account Executive, Customer Engineer or SDR with any information that could impact their work, even if it is just a status update.
  - Collaborate with your team on activities that would help the goals you have for customers like feature adoption or upgrading.
  - Utilize internal customer slack channels to keep internal stakeholders informed of what's going on. This doesn't mean provide a daily update, be thinking about whether or not there's relevant happenings that would benefit posting a proactive update in the internal customer channel.

### External

# General Customer Interaction

- Email, Slack, Zoom, or even in-person are all potential ways that you'll be interacting with your customers. Every customer should be contacted in some form at least once a month.

  - These would be a weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly all the way to quarterly 30-60 minute call, depending on the customer
  - For healthy accounts this could be a quick email or slack message
