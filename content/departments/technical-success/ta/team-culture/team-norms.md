# TA Team Norms

## Customer Segmentation

We segment our customers into [three discrete tiers](../../../../strategy-goals/strategy/index.md#market-segmentation). This segmentation is important in helping provide a consistent experience to our customers by defining the discrete activities that we want to deliver to every customer in a given tier. Using both the estimated number of developers and real ARR in our tiers ensures that customers have the proper resources attached to make them successful at scale while also letting us ensure the health of our own business.

### Tech Nurtured

Our Tech Nurtured function will serve customers who do not qualify for a dedicated Technical Advisor. This motion includes:

- An onboarding email to the instance admin detailing how to properly configure their instance, an introduction to our Discord community and our Support team email, and pointing them to our existing onboarding materials.
- A second email to the instance admin to be forwarded directly to the new end users. This email will include the training materials needed for an end user to ramp up on Sourcegraph.
- Monthly usage recap emails to the instance admin detailing feature usage.
- Separate monthly usage recap emails for customers who have fallen behind in upgrading their Sourcegraph instance, promoting our new features and offering guidance on how to upgrade.

We are utilizing Vitally to target and send our Tech Nurtured communications.

#### V2+

This motion is being iterated on quickly. Immediate next steps to improve the experience are:

- Dedicated training video playlists for every Sourcegraph Code Search and Cody feature

## Tooling

### Vitally

We use Vitally to stay organized internally around our customers. Your account should be able to look at just your book of business or the entire customer base.

### Salesforce

As the Sales system of record, we use Salesforce (and the data we bring into Vitally from Salesforce) as the source of contractual information such as revenue, licensing, and renewal & expansion opportunities.

### Looker

Looker is our product analytics tool that allows for deep inspection and analysis around customer utilization and consumption. While a subset of this information is synced into Vitally, a lot of data lives in Looker.

## Recurring Team Meetings

This team is highly focused on engaging our customers with valuable insight and information. We also are focused on internally surfacing customer information that is important to the business. This means both synchronous customer conversations throughout the day along with synchronous and asynchronous Sourcegraph processes.

Team meetings are held weekly.

## OOO Protocols

1. [Log time off request in Roots PTO](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/time-off/index.md)
