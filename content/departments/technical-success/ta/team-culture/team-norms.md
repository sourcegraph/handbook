# TA Team Norms

## Customer Segmentation

We segment our customers into four discrete tiers. This segmentation is important in helping provide a consistent experience to our customers by defining the discrete activities that we want to deliver to every customer in a given tier.

Our customer tiers are:
| Customer Tier | Tier Criteria |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Strategic | 40k+ employees OR $1m+ ARR |
| Large Enterprise | 10k - 40k employees OR $500k - $1m ARR |
| Small Enterprise | 5k - 10k employees OR $100k - $500k ARR |
| Mid-Market | Less than 5k employees AND less than $100k ARR |

## Tooling

### Vitally

We use Vitally stay organized internally around our customers. Your account should be able to look at just your book of business or the entire customer base.

### Salesforce

As the Sales system of record, we use Salesforce (and the data we bring into Vitally from Salesforce) as the source of contractual information such as revenue, licensing, and renewal & expansion opportunities. 

### Looker

Looker is our product analytics tool that allows for deep inspection and analysis around customer utilization and consumption. While a subset of this information is synced into Vitally a lot of data lives in Looker.

## Recurring Team Meetings

This team is highly focused on engaging our customers with valuable insight and information. We also are focused on internally surfacing customer information that is important to the business. This means both synchronous customer conversations throughout the day along with synchronous and asynchronous Sourcegraph processes.

Team meetings are held weekly.
