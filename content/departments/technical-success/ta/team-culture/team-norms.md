# TA Team Norms

## Customer Segmentation

We segment our customers into [three discrete tiers](../../../../strategy-goals/strategy/index.md#market-segmentation). This segmentation is important in helping provide a consistent experience to our customers by defining the discrete activities that we want to deliver to every customer in a given tier. Using both the estimated number of developers and real ARR in our tiers ensures that customers have the proper resources attached to make them successful at scale while also letting us ensure the health of our own business.

### Scaled Success Program

Our Scaled Success program serves customers who do not qualify for a dedicated Technical Advisor in digital-first, tech-nurtured manner. This motion includes:

- Onboarding:
  - Admin: emails detailing how to properly configure their instance, an introduction to our Discord community and our Support team email, and pointing them to our existing onboarding materials.
  - End users: sent to the account point of contact, to be forwarded directly to the new end users. This email will include the training materials needed for an end user to ramp up on Sourcegraph.
- Ongoing Communication:
  - Monthly usage recap emails to the instance admin detailing feature usage.
  - Release notices and product updates.
  - Separate monthly usage recap emails for customers who have fallen behind in upgrading their Sourcegraph instance, promoting our new features and offering guidance on how to upgrade.

We are utilizing Vitally to target and send all communications.

#### V2+

Our Scaled Success program is being iterated on quickly. Immediate next steps to improve the experience are:

- Dedicated training video playlists for every Sourcegraph Code Search and Cody feature

## Tooling

### Vitally

We use Vitally to stay organized internally around our customers. This is the central tool and source of truth for TAs across their customers and book of business. TAs should use Vitally to plan and organize their strategy and activities across their customers.

Vitally calculates our customer health score and is the mechanism by which we facilitate:
- pre-to-post sales handoff from CE to TA
- scaled customer success communications
- our renewal process
- quarterly success plans for customer goals & expected outcomes
- the lighthouse program for corrective action on accounts

This [Dashboard](https://sourcegraph.vitally.io/work/team/dashboards/eee503ef-886f-4eba-b416-866f0aef71bb) can be used to see the current state of these traits for your accounts all in one spot.


### Salesforce

As the Sales system of record, we use Salesforce (and the data we bring into Vitally from Salesforce) as the source of contractual information such as revenue, licensing, and renewal & expansion opportunities.

### Looker

Looker is our product analytics tool that allows for deep inspection and analysis around customer utilization and consumption. While a subset of this information is synced into Vitally, a lot of data lives in Looker.

## Recurring Team Meetings

This team is highly focused on engaging our customers with valuable insight and information. We also are focused on internally surfacing customer information that is important to the business. This means both synchronous customer conversations throughout the day along with synchronous and asynchronous Sourcegraph processes.

Team meetings are held weekly.

## OOO Protocols

Prior to taking time off, TAs should:

1. [Log time off request in Deel PTO](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/time-off/index.md)
1. Work with their manager and peers to create a coverage plan
1. Notify their customers through the appropriate channel of their upcoming OOO
1. Update their slack status accordingly with OOO dates indicated
