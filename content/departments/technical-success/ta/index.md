# Technical Advisors (TA)

## Who we are

Technical Advisors (TA) serve as specialized technical experts focused on our customers' experience and relationships post-sales. We seek to deliver a consistent engagement experience to customers rooted in providing value to them such that they achieve their desired positive business outcomes within their business. We seek to reduce time to initial customer value by training and enabling our dev end users on how to use and integrate Sourcegraph into their workflows. We also strive to help our customers maximize their return on investment (ROI) and do so by continuously monitoring the health of our customers, becoming trusted advisors to them on all things Sourcegraph and engineering, and building out the tools and processes internally to do this job as effectively as possible. We are responsible for ensuring that customers are achieving their success metrics and that they continue to find new valuable use cases for Sourcegraph.

## Our Team Purpose Statement

Becoming a trusted advisor to our customers to enable them to better solve their engineering challenges

## Team KPIs / Measures of Success

We use the following metrics to gauge the effectiveness and success of our team:

- Utilization (Adoption)
- Consumption (Usage)
- Retention

While those metrics are good for our business, the driving factor should be making that the customer is successful in their own business, and that Sourcegraph is a critical tool in that process that proves invaluable to their organization.

### Utilization (Adoption)

We consider healthy adoption / utilization to comprise of at least 80% consumption of purchased seats as measured by Monthly Active Users (MAU) / Total Licensed Seats. We aim to get to 80% consumption within the first 45 days of the engagement (after the production environment is established) and maintain at least 80% consumption at all times.

### Consumption (Usage)

TAs seek to educate and enable customer devs on how to integrate Sourcegraph into their workflows so that they are using it multiple times every single day. While today we calculate usage based on Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU), we're refining this exact benchmark heading into and through FY24.

### Retention

Everything a TA does should positively influence the long-term relationship we have with our customers. TA doesn't have explicit commercial obligations - the Account Executive does - but our efforts to drive outcomes (via adoption) and deliver value to our customers impact ultimate retention.
