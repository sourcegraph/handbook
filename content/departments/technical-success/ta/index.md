# Technical Advisors (TA)

## Who we are

Technical Advisors (TA) focus on the post-sales success of our customers. We are successful when our customers realize expected value and achieve positive outcomes within their business by using Sourcegraph.

## Our Team Purpose Statement

Becoming a trusted advisor to our customers to enable them to better solve their engineering challenges

## Technical Advisory Teams

The Technical Advisory organization is comprised of three teams:

- [Enterprise Technical Advisors](enterprise-success/index.md)
  - Named and dedicated to specific customers
  - Provides a high-touch, highly customized experience
- [Scaled Technical Advisors](scaled-success/index.md)
  - Non-dedicated but shared across a set of customers
  - Provides a medium-touch, customized experience that also leverages digital programming
- [Digital Technical Advisors](digital-success/index.md)
  - Non-dedicated, on-demand coverage across a large set of customers
  - Provides a low-touch experience that relies heavily on automated tooling

## TA Segmentation

We segment our customers into [four discrete tiers](../../../strategy-goals/strategy/index.md#market-segmentation). This segmentation is important in helping provide a consistent experience to our customers by defining the discrete activities that we want to deliver to every customer in a given tier. Using the estimated number of developers in our tiers ensures that customers have the proper resources attached to make them successful at scale while also letting us ensure the health of our own business.
