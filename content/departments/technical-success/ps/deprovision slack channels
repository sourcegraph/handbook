## Deprovision Slack Channels

The following outlines the deprovisioning process for customers not purchasing a Slack offering.

**Step 1: Identify Upcoming Renewal**
- Prior to renewal please identify if the customer will be purchasing Slack Support or Slack Account Management. If they will be discontinuing with either please follow the following steps:

**Step 2: Customer Conversation**
- The AE and TA assigned to the customer should reach out via Slack or schedule a meeting to discuss the deprecation of the channel.

**Step 3: Channel Announcement**
AE sends the following message in the appropriate channel 14 days before decommissioning to inform the customer about the upcoming deprovisioning. This will give them time to address any concerns or upgrade their plan. Message:
“Notification - Slack Support has not been included in the upcoming renewal contract. As such, this channel will be deprecated on <Date>. If you have questions or concerns, please reach out to your admin. Thank you.”

**Step 4: Notify Customer Support Leadership**
AE- Ping #discuss-customer-support and tag @cs-leadership to inform them about the need to remove Foqal (replace with the customer name) from Slack. Provide any relevant details or context.
** If the customer is purchasing Slack account management please disregard Step 5.**

**Step 5: Request Channel Deletion**
AE Create a post in #ask-it-tech-ops requesting the deletion of the Slack channel associated with Foqal (replace with the customer name). Include the necessary information, such as the customer's account details and the reason for deprovisioning.
