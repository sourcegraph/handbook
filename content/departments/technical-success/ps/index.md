# Professional Services (PS)

## Who we are

#### Our Professional Services (PS) team is comprised of several groups:

- The Implementation Engineering (IE) team at Sourcegraph is a dedicated team of engineers and project managers who specialize and have expertise in deploying, installing, and configuring Sourcegraph within customer's cloud and on-premise environments. The IE team primarily focuses on complex Kubernetes deployments, while also assisting the Customer Engineering and Technical Advisor teams with smaller scale tasks. Implementation Engineers work front and center directly with customers, in collaboration with internal teams, to lead the implementation effort and get Sourcegraph running in customer environments quickly and efficiently.
- Implementation Project Managers oversee the internal and external tasks, needs, and dependencies across these implementations, and also handles internal and external reporting.
- Resident Architects (RAs) provide strategic technical success planning, tailored ongoing enablement, and hands-on assistance for adoption and utilization of features while activating advanced use cases for customers via direct access to customer systems and teams.

## Who we work with

Our PS teams work primarily in support of Strategic customers as they deploy Sourcegraph into production environments. IE is introduced to the customer at the start of a contract, and will work closely with the customer to ensure all deployment success criteria are met. IE will additionally provide Sourcegraph-specific insights such as optimizing allocation of compute resources for the customer instance and configuration and deployment best practices. IE typically works in an advisory role to the customer with regular deployment syncs, asynchronous support, and ad-hoc, hands-on working sessions.
