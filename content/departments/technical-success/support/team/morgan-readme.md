# Morgan Gautho

## Individual view on customer service/support:

A customer's perception of an overall product/experience is all going to boil down to support. Did they feel understood/listened to/cared for? Our job is to make sure the answer is Yes.

## Preferred learning styles:

Generally I prefer to learn by doing, less upfront instruction and more small, bite-sized tasks. I will always prefer digging into something myself over watching a video.

## Communication style:

I respond well to transparency and generally prefer to err on the side of over-communication, especially when learning and working out a problem. The more details, the better!

## Preferred way to collaborate:

I enjoy collaborating in groups or 1:1. I like Zoom or Slack, but prefer Zoom if it's a topic that requries any back and forth or time sensitive answers.

## How you approach problems:

I usually like to define the problem, and then trace a thread from the problem, working backwards, until I can find a solution. If I'm not sure where to start, I like to start from a place I know and follow the same process, even if I am traversing areas that have nothing to do with the issue. If I get stuck at any point, I will ask for help and turn to other resources.

## Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated:

A quick note or message goes a long way!

## Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help:

I like to attempt things on my own before asking for help, but once I have a grasp of what needs to be done/what I need help with, I will ask for help to make sure I'm on the right track.

## What you find enjoyable at work:

I love working with people and resolving issues. Whether that be among co-workers or customers, being able to clarify something or solve a problem for a person is always satisfying!

## What kind of work do you find easiest to do when (for example, some folks write best at night or can focus more easily in the afternoon):

I find it easiest to do admin-type work in the mornings, and more involved work at night.

## How do you feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for you to see and respond to during active hours:

I don't mind! I'll get to it when I can, and if it's more urgent than that, feel free to let me know and (if I'm able) I'll try to resolve ASAP.

## How folks can best show up for us when we seem off (give space, ask if work is the right place for us to be today, etc):

If I seem off, please let me know! I usually know myself well enough to know if I need to take action based on what I'm feeling, but if it's impacting my work or the people around me, it doesn't hurt to remind me to re-evaluate.

## Things you are aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work:

If I feel like I'm not making any progress on a certain issue, or not meeting deadlines.

## Areas of knowledge:

Fullstack development

## Areas of interest to learn:

More docker and kubernetes, Go

## Current personal project:

VERY slow-going - but working on a project to "edit" song lyrics, so you could type in different lyrics and then use transfer learning to mimic the style of the song, and re-insert the new lyrics.

## Something you fear:

Running into a bear or shark (I spend a lot of time in the ocean and in Tahoe)

## A quote you like:

"Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans." John Lennon

## How you eat fries (with or without ketchup (ketchup on the fries or on the side), etc):

Big fan of all fries - the crispier the better and sauces on the side or dipped in a milkshake.

## Your sun, moon, and rising signs (if you are into this kind of thing):

I'm born on the Virgo-Leo cusp, but _technically_ Leo sun (with a lot of Virgo tendencies), Pisces Moon, Cancer rising.
