### View on Customer Support

Good Support comes from being able to put yourself in the customer's shoes and truly empathize with their problems.
That, together with some collaboration makes any problem much easier to solve.

### Preferred learning style

I like getting thrown into things and learn by doing but also appreciate a good guide or visual (definitely a visual learner).

### Communication style

I am open to multiple ways of communication. Whether its a quick Zoom call to be on the same page or more async via Slack, as long as I am able to fully understand what we're talking about and can have an honest conversation.

### Collaboration style

I always like a good pairing session over Zoom whether its in a small group or a bigger one.

### Approach to problems

I like to approach problems (tickets or otherwise) in three steps:

1. Understand the problem and what we're trying to solve

2. Do research on ideas, workarounds, next steps

3. Validate solution/further clarify and go back to step 2 until resolved.


### Preferred way to be recognized

I'm open to any type of recognition as long as its deserved and genuine.


### What I enjoy at work

I like solving technical issues and helping engineers solve technical issues. Talking through a problem and getting to a "aha!" moment is something a thoroughly enjoy.

### Thoughts on asking for help

There is no such thing as a stupid question. I like people teaching me and guiding me on things I don't know anything about.

### Preferred time to work

Mornings with meetings followed by some afternoon focus time.

### Feelings to receiving messages outside work hours

Send them away! If I'm not around or available I will answer as soon as I can!

### How to show up when I'm feeling off

Always feel free to message me and ask if everything is okay! Bonus points if you send a funny meme or a cute dog pic.
