### Individual view on customer service/support

Service is the most important aspect in choosing one service over another. Knowing that someone will be there after the sale is enough to make me a loyal consumer

### Preferred learning styles

When I am in the beginning stages of learning something I prefer to self-study by reading or watching a video.

I like doing group studies to take a deeper dive and learn from others and answer any questions others might have.
