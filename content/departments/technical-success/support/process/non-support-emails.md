# Handling Non-Support Emails

Occasionally, non-support emails will be sent to support@sourcegraph.com, either cold outreach, employment verification, bills, marketing, or spam. We can forward these emails to the appropriate team and close the ticket.

**Marking Spam:**  
If an email is spam, navigate to the ticket menu and select ‘Mark as spam’.

**Forwarding Emails:**  
To forward an email, expand the menu on the message and click ‘Forward via email’. ZenDesk removes the original sender's email from the forward, so paste it into the message. If you need to access the support mailbox, use the credentials in the shared 1Password vault.

**Determining the Appropriate Recipient:**  
Consult the relevant Slack channel to identify the correct recipient for the email:
#discuss-marketing: Cold outreach, marketing, media.  
#ask-people-team: Employment verification, job applications, etc.  
#discuss-finance: Bills, POs, or receipts.

If you are unsure where to direct an email or need help determining the appropriate action, request guidance in the #team-support-engineering channel.
