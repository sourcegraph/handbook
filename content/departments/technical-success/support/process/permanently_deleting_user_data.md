# Deleting user data

When users request deletion of their account data, whether for personal preference or GDPR compliance, the support team handles and routes these requests. Please send these requests to support@sourcegraph.com to ensure they enter the support queue.

## Handling Data Deletion Requests

First, identify if the request is for account deletion or specifically for data deletion, which we treat as a GDPR request. Use keywords like 'Permanently delete all my user data,' 'GDPR request,' and 'CCPA request' to guide your assessment. If it's unclear what the user wants, request clarification or seek advice in #team-support-engineering.

## Data deletions

Data deletion requests require coordination with sales and analytics to remove data from all systems, in addition to the steps for account deletion.

- [ ] Initiate user data removal from our systems by creating a [deletion request GitHub issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/customer/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=user-data-deletion.md&title=Request+to+permanently+delete+all+user+data+for%3A+someone%40example.com) as a checklist.

- [ ] Delete previous tickets from a requester
  - On Zendesk, search the user with the email address associated with the account and requesting deletion. You can also click their name on the deletion ticket they created.
  - Select all tickets that are¬†**not**¬†the current request. We need to save their current request for legal reasons.
  - Click on the Edit X ticket(s) button
  - Confirm the deletion
