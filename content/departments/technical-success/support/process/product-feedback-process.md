# Product feedback

We frequently receive feedback through tickets or upon their resolution. It's important to distinguish this feedback from bugs and [product gaps](../../../product/process/feedback/surfacing_product_requests.md#what-is-a-product-gap). Product feedback refers to prospects' or customers' observations, comments, or opinions about the product experience. It may relate to the product's implementation or areas that are unclear or could be enhanced. For more information on product feedback, please refer to the [Surfacing Product Feedback](../../../product/process/feedback/surfacing_product_requests.md#what-is-a-product-gap) section in our handbook.

**Where to Share Feedback:**

- Post the feedback in either the #feedback-cody or #feedback-code-search channels.
- Include a link to the original feedback and tag the account’s Technical Advisor to ensure they have the full context.
- If you're unsure whether the feedback is a product gap or product feedback, reach out to the account’s Technical Advisor or #team-support-engineering for guidance.
