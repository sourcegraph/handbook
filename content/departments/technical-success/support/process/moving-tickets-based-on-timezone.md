# Moving tickets that require a different timezone

There may be times when a ticket is answered by an SE in a different region than the customer's. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as low priority, engineer availability, or scheduling issues. It's essential to ensure that tickets are moved to the appropriate region's support team for continued follow-up and resolution.

For P0 and P1 tickets, they should be reassigned to the region where they will receive the most direct attention. If in doubt, it's always better to ask the customer to confirm the ticket's correct timezone.

For P2 and P3 tickets, they can be worked on asynchronously as long as progress continues, and the customer does not explicitly ask for the ticket to be moved. These tickets carry a lower priority and should still be able to be worked on.

If you need to move a ticket, please follow these steps:

1. If the ticket is new, make sure to send a first response to avoid breaking our SLAs.
1. If the ticket has some history, provide a brief summary of the issue, any steps you've taken, and any potential next steps to set up the next engineer for success.
1. Add an internal note indicating that the customer is in a different timezone and that the ticket should be taken by someone else:
   ```
   Customer is based on MST. Moving back to queue for a US teammate to take.
   ```
1. Unassign yourself from the ticket on Zendesk and Foqal.
