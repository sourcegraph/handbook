# CEO Shadow Program

## Overview
This is an overview of the CEO Shadow Program. Please feel free to contact the Chief of Staff or [Executive Business Partner to the CEO](mailto:sally.voisen@sourcegraph.com) with any questions, comments, or concerns.

The CEO Shadow Program is a 2-week,  temporary “rotation” for [eligible employees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12VJCjnNYrpclOiacRBR0-2PfDt3Ig7omDSdA2Xo_oHo/edit#bookmark=id.so92xhkwsr2l) to shadow the CEO. As part of the rotation, the CEO Shadow can expect to:
- Be present and participate in (nearly) every meeting and conversation the CEO is in.
- Act as a “thoughtful sounding board” / thought partner for the CEO as they operate the business. 
- Start, take over, and run with a number of strategic projects that need stewardship.
- Gain insight and visibility into how the company is run, decisions are made, and priorities are set from the CEO’s vantage point.

## Goal and Intention of the Program
The CEO Shadow will give eligible employees an up-close look at the day-to-day life of the Sourcegraph CEO, Sourcegraph’s business strategies at work, and decision-making at the top. This access should further increase transparency and visibility into how Sourcegraph is run while better enabling the CEO Shadow to work cross-functionally and better align their core work to company strategies.

This program is designed to create more meaningful relationships between the CEO and teammates to open up paths of communication that can / and should lead to quicker action on challenges and opportunities as they arise.   

## What the CEO shadow program is NOT
The CEO Shadow program is not a professional or leadership development program. Being a CEO Shadow is not related to your performance (though, you must meet the [eligibility criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12VJCjnNYrpclOiacRBR0-2PfDt3Ig7omDSdA2Xo_oHo/edit#bookmark=id.so92xhkwsr2l)). Lastly, the CEO shadow program is not “extra work” on top of your core work. CEO Shadow rotations should be treated as paid leave by their department and the teammate.  

## Typical responsibilities
As the Shadow CEO, you will have unprecedented access to the CEO. As such, you will be expected to contribute to their, and the company’s, development in a meaningful way. 
This will typically involve: 
- Openly, thoughtfully, and respectfully observe, challenge, and question the CEO + Exec Team’s thinking, assumptions, and decisions.
- Providing a “bottoms-up” perspective.
- Some administrative work like: updating the weekly Exec Team agenda, helping craft weekly priorities for the CEO, following up on action items, decisions, etc. 
- You will be fully focused on this experience and not doing any of your typical / core work. 
- Understanding the CEO Shadow role is a privilege where you will be exposed to confidential and proprietary information. CEO Shadows must honor the confidentiality of topics being discussed and information shared.  
- Record an external-facing  video / blog post on their experience to help with recruitment, company brand, etc. [(CEO Shadow Content)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gbL9f0h0aGe8F5ul-6YCDjpG5TTmMV8D?usp=sharing)
- Train / enable new CEO Shadows for their upcoming rotation.

## Cadence and Flow
The CEO Shadow program will run in 2-week cycles. The Shadow CEO will reach out to the existing Shadow CEO on 2nd Wednesday of their rotation to begin the handover. 

### RequiredTravel
The CEO shadow will accompany the CEO on any business travel. 

### Off-sites and Board Meetings
The CEO Shadow will not participate in Exec Team Off-site or Board meetings. Should a rotation fall over one of those events, the CEO Shadow rotation will split the weeks to fall before and after the off-sites / board meetings. 

## Eligibility & Participation

### Eligibility
All Sourcegraph teammates in good standing (not on a performance plan) are eligible for the CEO Shadow Program. 

### Participation
As a CEO Shadow you are expected to be in-person with the CEO for at least 1 of the 2 weeks of your rotation. This is a break from our async culture, but given the [goal and intention](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12VJCjnNYrpclOiacRBR0-2PfDt3Ig7omDSdA2Xo_oHo/edit#bookmark=id.so92xhkwsr2l) of the program, the CEO Shadow program is an exception. 

Understanding, not everyone can take 2 weeks away from family and life commitments, Sourcegraph will help pay for and cover childcare costs and other life expenses to help ensure an inclusive program for all Sourcegraph teammates.

1. Work with your manager to find a rotation that can be accommodated by your team in the [CEO Shadow Rotation Sign-up]([(See available dates here)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1HqcXD5qZ6drKp1OEvGRM_o8tUuzydvzQJzcaOz-kMNs/edit)) document.
