# CEO Shadow Program

## Overview

This is an overview of the CEO Shadow Program. Please feel free to contact the CEO team, @connor o'brien (Chief of Staff to the CEO) or @sally voisen (Sr. EBP to the CEO) on slack with any questions, comments, feedback, or concerns.

The CEO Shadow Program typically lasts between 1-2 business days. It is a temporary rotation for all [eligible teammates](ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility) where they will get an up-close look at the day-to-day life of the Sourcegraph [CEO](../../team/ceo/index.md), Sourcegraph’s business strategies at work, and decision-making at the top. This rotation, if done right, should increase transparency and visibility into how Sourcegraph is run while better enabling the CEO Shadow to work cross-functionally and better align their core work to company strategies after the rotation.

## Goal and intention of the program

The overarching goal of the CEO Shadow program is to give [eligible teammates](ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility) broad exposure to every possible facet of the business while working directly with the CEO on a more personal level.

## What the CEO shadow program is NOT

The CEO Shadow program is not a professional or leadership development program. Being a CEO Shadow is not related to your performance (though, you must meet the [eligibility criteria](ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility). Lastly, the CEO shadow program is not “extra work” on top of your job, but different work instead.

## Typical responsibilities

As the Shadow CEO, you will have unprecedented access to the CEO / exec team and be exposed to confidential and proprietary information. CEO Shadows must honor the confidentiality of content, topics, and information being discussed.

Additionally, CEO Shadows are expected to do more than just "tag along". The expectation is the CEO Shadow will meaningfully contribute to conversations, meetings, content development, program / projects, etc. as they are able.

Examples of typical tasks and responsibilities of a CEO Shadow:

- Provide a “bottoms-up” perspective as you openly, thoughtfully, and respectfully observe, challenge, and collaborate with the CEO and exec team on company business.
- Help craft weekly priorities for the CEO
- Take notes (as directed) and follow up on action items, decisions, etc. from the meetings you attend
- Record an external-facing video / blog post on your experience to help with recruitment, company brand, etc.
- Train / enable new CEO Shadows for their upcoming rotation.

## Eligibility & Participation

### Eligibility

All Sourcegraph teammates in good standing (i.e. not on a performance plan) are eligible for the CEO Shadow Program.

### Participation

The CEO Shadow Program typically lasts between 1-2 business days. The length and timing of the rotation is subject to change given Quinn's and the Shadow's schedules. The CEO team will do it's best to keep agreed upon dates, with the understanding there are external factors that cause Quinn's availability to shift dramatically on a moment's notice.

This program is intended to be in-person and is a break from our async culture. However, given the [goal and intention](ceo-shadow-program.md#goal-and-intention-of-the-program) of the program, the CEO Shadow program should be an exception. Every effort will be made to ensure this program is inclusive. Please reach out to the CEO team, @connor o'brien (Chief of Staff to the CEO) or @sally voisen (Sr. EBP to the CEO) on Slack if you have extenuating circumstances that are keeping you from participating in-person and we’ll do our best to accommodate.

Participation in the CEO Shadow Program is not added work to your job. Participating in the CEO Shadow program means you are taking a leave from your core job responsibilites to focus on being a CEO Shadow. Participation in the CEO Shadow program is not PTO as you will be working in a different capacity.

## How to apply

1. Work with your manager and cross-reference [this doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqcXD5qZ6drKp1OEvGRM_o8tUuzydvzQJzcaOz-kMNs/edit#gid=0) to find a few dates that could work.
2. Once you've identified a few dates, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQXYDlypKgCEzGy8ifFFUuuLERRpSLKRFUGaoJgpsCUqU_QA/viewform) to kick off the request process.
3. The Sr. Executive Business Partner to the CEO (@sally voisen on Slack) will then reach out to coordinate and schedule your rotation date(s) and discuss program logistics (where to stay, when to arrive, what to expect, etc.). Most answers to these questions should be answered on this handbook page. If they are not, please don't hesitate to reach out for clarification.

## Preparation

We encourage upcoming Shadows to review prior shadows [blogs / vlogs](ceo-shadow-program.md#past-ceo-shadow-experiences) or reach out to them directly to discuss their experience. You can also reach out to the CEO team, @connor o'brien (Chief of Staff to the CEO) or @sally voisen (Sr. EBP to the CEO). (Sally will proactively reach out to you if there is anything specific Quinn would like to work with you on.)

### Travel & Expenses

The CEO Shadow Program is designed to provide a unique and compelling opportunity to all Sourcegraph teammates. Its goal is to be as inclusive as possible, so any and all travel-related expenses (detailed below) will be covered by the program and not draw down from your [individual travel budget](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel/index.md).

**NOTE:** Quinn's calendar is very fluid. CEO shadows are permitted to book refundable airfare in the event Quinn's schedule changes resulting in rescheduling your rotation.

#### Lodging

Lodging during the CEO shadow program is provided by the company and will only cover for the "active" shadowing period. If traveling a long distance and lodging is needed beyond the rotation, please clear it with the Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) first.

Lodging is booked in accordance with our [company travel policy](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel/index.md). Please book your lodging through Navan.

We typically suggest CEO Shadows stay in San Francisco, but CEO Shadows should work with the Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) on where to stay to minimize travel and expense based on Quinn's calendar.

#### Airfare

Airfare is booked in accordance with our [company travel policy](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel/index.md). Please book your airfare through Navan.

#### Transportation to / from the airport

At San Francisco International airport (SFO), all rideshare apps (Uber, Lyft, etc) pick up on level 5 of the parking structure. Taxis [pick up on the Arrivals/Baggage Claim Level](https://www.flysfo.com/content/taxis#:~:text=Taxis%20depart%20from%20the%20designated,passengers%20with%20questions%20or%20concerns.) for all terminals. The [BART](https://www.bart.gov/) (Bay Area Rapid Transit / our local metro / train) also runs from [SFO to San Francisco](https://www.bart.gov/schedules).

#### Expensing meals

CEO Shadows should follow our [company travel policy](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel/index.md) in regards to food and dining. The Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) will work with the finance team to enable the correct spend category in Airbase for you to submit expenses against.

#### Childcare

Childcare is covered during the active shadowing period and will be reimbursed via your expense report. The Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) will work with the finance team to enable the correct spend category in Airbase for you to submit expenses against.

#### Required Business Travel

The CEO shadow will accompany the CEO on any and all business travel.

## CEO shadow rotation exclusions

The CEO Shadow will not participate in exec team off-sites, working sessions, or board meetings. Should your proposed dates fall within one of those events, the Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) will work with you on identifying alternative dates for your rotation.

During the rotation, CEO shadows will sit out of 1-1s and will join the first half of the exec team meeting (45 mins).

## Blog post / interview

Part of your participation as a CEO Shadow is to create a blog / vlog post about your time as the CEO Shadow.

## Tips and Tricks to working with Quinn

Working with Quinn is great. As with all people, we have our preferences for communication and working styles. In order to make efficent use of yours and Quinn’s time, here are a few guidelines to consider when working with Quinn.

- Quinn’s in-person style mirrors his writing style closely -- brevity, honesty, and directness are preferred.
- Don’t be afraid to share candid feedback.
- Quinn really values thoughtful discussions and debates. He will push and challenge you and he expects you to do the same.
- Meetings are often back-to-back with short 5-15 minute breaks built in. Be mindful of this time before starting a converation on a topic that may require more than the time available.
