# CEO Shadow Program

## Overview

This is an overview of the CEO Shadow Program. Please feel free to contact the [Chief of Staff to the CEO](@connor o'brien) with any questions, comments, feedback, or concerns.

The CEO Shadow Program typically lasts between 1 and 5 business days (1 business week). It is a temporary rotation for all [eligible teammates](ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility) where they will get an up-close look at the day-to-day life of the Sourcegraph [CEO](../../team/ceo/index.md), Sourcegraph’s business strategies at work, and decision-making at the top. This rotation, if done right, should increase transparency and visibility into how Sourcegraph is run while better enabling the CEO Shadow to work cross-functionally and better align their core work to company strategies after the rotation.

## Goal and intention of the program

The overarching goal of the CEO Shadow program is to give [eligible teammates](ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility) broad exposure to every possible facet of the business while working directly with the CEO on a more personal level.

## What the CEO shadow program is NOT

The CEO Shadow program is not a professional or leadership development program. Being a CEO Shadow is not related to your performance (though, you must meet the [eligibility criteria](ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility). Lastly, the CEO shadow program is not “extra work” on top of your core work. CEO Shadow rotations should be treated as paid leave by their department and the teammate.

## Typical responsibilities

As the Shadow CEO, you will have unprecedented access to the CEO / exec team and be exposed to confidential and proprietary information. CEO Shadows must honor the confidentiality of content, topics, and information being discussed.

Additionally, CEO Shadows are expected to do more than just "tag along". The expectation is the CEO Shadow will meaningfully contribute to conversations, meetings, content development, program / projects, etc. as they are able.

Examples of typical tasks and responsibilities of a CEO Shadow:

- Provide a “bottoms-up” perspective as you openly, thoughtfully, and respectfully observe, challenge, and collaborate with the CEO and exec team on company business.
- Help craft weekly priorities for the CEO
- Take notes (as directed) and follow up on action items, decisions, etc. from the meetings you attend
- Record an external-facing video / blog post on your experience to help with recruitment, company brand, etc.
- Train / enable new CEO Shadows for their upcoming rotation.

## Eligibility & Participation

### Eligibility

All Sourcegraph teammates in good standing (not on a performance plan) are eligible for the CEO Shadow Program.

### Participation

The CEO Shadow Program typically lasts between 1 and 5 business days (1 business week). The length and timing of your shadow program is subject to change given Quinn's and the Shadow's schedules. The CEO team will do it's best to not deviate from the pre-agreed dates, but please understand there are external factors that cause Quinn's availability to shift dramatically on a moment's notice.

This progeram is intended to be in-person and is a break from our async culture. However, given the [goal and intention](ceo-shadow-program/#goal-and-intention-of-the-program) of the program, the CEO Shadow program should be an exception. Every effort will be made to ensure this program is as inclusive as possible. Please reach out to the [Chief of Staff to the CEO](@connor o'brien) if you have extenuating circumstances that are keeping you from participating and we’ll do our best to accommodate.

Participation in the CEO Shadow Program is not additive work to your day job. Participating in the CEO Shadow program means you are taking a leave from your core job responsibilites to focus on being a CEO Shadow. Participation in the CEO Shadow program will not draw down from your available PTO as you will still be working, but in a different capacity.
