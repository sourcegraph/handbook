# CEO Shadow Program

## Overview

This is an overview of the CEO Shadow Program. Please feel free to contact the [Chief of Staff](mailto:connor.obrien@sourcegraph.com) or [Executive Business Partner to the CEO](mailto:sally.voisen@sourcegraph.com) with any questions, comments, feedback, or concerns.

The CEO Shadow Program could run as short as 1 day or as long as 1 week. It is a temporary rotation for all [eligible employees](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/blob/main/ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility) where they are provided the opportunity to learn about the various functions of Sourcegraph from the perspective of the CEO. As part of the rotation, the CEO Shadow can expect to:

- Interact with every function of the business.
- Act as a “thoughtful sounding board” to the CEO.
- Engage external stakeholders / connections (board members, banks, other CEOs, etc.)
- Sit and learn through exposure.

## Goal and intention of the program

The CEO Shadow will give [eligible employees](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/blob/main/ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility) an up-close look at the day-to-day life of the Sourcegraph [CEO](../../team/ceo/index.md), Sourcegraph’s business strategies at work, and decision-making at the top. This rotation, if done right, should increase transparency and visibility into how Sourcegraph is run while better enabling the CEO Shadow to work cross-functionally and better align their core work to company strategies.

In addition, this program is designed to humanize the [CEO](../../team/ceo/index.md) (and the executive team) so that teammates are more confident and comfortable collaborating and providing direct feedback to the [CEO](../../team/ceo/index.md) and the exec team after the rotation is over.

## Past CEO Shadow experiences

## What the CEO shadow program is NOT

The CEO Shadow program is not a professional or leadership development program. Being a CEO Shadow is not related to your performance (though, you must meet the [eligibility criteria](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/blob/main/ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility)). Lastly, the CEO shadow program is not “extra work” on top of your core work. CEO Shadow rotations should be treated as paid leave by their department and the teammate.

## Typical responsibilities

As the Shadow CEO, you will have unprecedented access to the CEO / exec team and be exposed to confidential and proprietary information. CEO Shadows must honor the confidentiality of content, topics, and information being discussed.

Additionally, CEO Shadows are expected to do more than just "tag along". The expectation is the CEO Shadow will meaningfully contribute to conversations, meetings, and content development as they are able.

Examples of typical tasks and responsibilities of a CEO Shadow:

- Provide a “bottoms-up” perspective as you openly, thoughtfully, and respectfully observe, challenge, and collaborate with the CEO and exec team on company business.
- Help craft weekly priorities for the CEO
- Take notes (as directed) and following up on action items, decisions, etc. from the meetings you attend
- Record an external-facing video / blog post on your experience to help with recruitment, company brand, etc.
- Train / enable new CEO Shadows for their upcoming rotation.

## Eligibility & Participation

### Eligibility

All Sourcegraph teammates in good standing (not on a performance plan) are eligible for the CEO Shadow Program.

### Participation

As a CEO Shadow, your shadow experience could run as short as 1 day or as long as 1 week. The length and timing of your shadow program is subject to change given Quinn's constantly evolving schedule. The CEO team will do it's best to not deviate from the pre-agreed dates, but please understand there are external factors that cause Quinn's availability to shift dramatically on a moment's notice.

This program is a break from our async culture, but given the [goal and intention](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/edit/main/content/departments/ceo-team/ceo-shadow-program.md#goal-and-intention-of-the-program) of the program, the CEO Shadow program is an exception. As such, efforts will be made to ensure this program is as inclusive as possible. Please reach out to the [Chief of Staff](@Connor O'Brien) or [Executive Business Partner to the CEO](@Sally Voisen) if you have extenuating circumstances that are keeping you from participating and we’ll do our best to accommodate.

Participation in the CEO Shadow Program is not additive work to your day job. Participating in the CEO Shadow program means you are taking a leave from your core job responsibilites to focus on being a CEO Shadow. Participation in the CEO Shadow program will not draw down from your available PTO as you will still be working, but in a different capacity.

## How to apply

1. Work with your manager to find a rotation date [(see available dates here)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1HqcXD5qZ6drKp1OEvGRM_o8tUuzydvzQJzcaOz-kMNs/edit) that can be accommodated by your team.
2. Put your name in an open cell (if your desired date is filled, put your name in one of the "back up participant" cells and we'll work with the relevant people to accommodate everyone's schedules).
3. Go to the #ceo-shadow slack channel and @ mention Connor O'Brien (Chief of Staff to the CEO)
4. You will receive confirmation of your rotation date from the Chief of Staff to the CEO within 48-72 hours.

## Preparation

We encourage upcoming Shadows to review prior shadows [blogs / vlogs](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/edit/main/content/departments/ceo-team/ceo-shadow-program.md#past-ceo-shadow-experiences) or reach out to them directly to discuss their experience. You can also reach out to the Chief of Staff to the CEO directly (they will alos proactively reach out to you if there is anything specific Quinn would like to work with you on).

### Travel & Expenses

The CEO Shadow Program is designed to provide a unique and compelling opportunity to any and all Sourcegraph teammates. It's aim is to be as inclusive as possible so any and all travel-related expenses (detailed below) will be covered by the program and not draw down from your [individual travel budget](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel/index.md).

#### Lodging

Lodging during the CEO shadow program is provided by the company and will only cover for the "active" shadowing period. If travling a long distance and loding is needed over the weekend, please clear with the Chief of Staff (@Connor O'Brien )first.
