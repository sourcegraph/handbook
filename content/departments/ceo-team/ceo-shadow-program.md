# CEO Shadow Program

## Overview

This is an overview of the CEO Shadow Program. Please feel free to contact the CEO team, @connor o'brien (Chief of Staff to the CEO) or @sally voisen (Sr. EBP to the CEO) on slack with any questions, comments, feedback, or concerns.

The CEO Shadow Program typically lasts between 1-2 business days. It is a temporary rotation for all [eligible teammates](ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility) where they will get an up-close look at the day-to-day life of the Sourcegraph [CEO](../../team/ceo/index.md), Sourcegraph’s business strategies at work, and decision-making at the top. This rotation, if done right, should increase transparency and visibility into how Sourcegraph is run while better enabling the CEO Shadow to work cross-functionally and better align their core work to company strategies after the rotation.

## Goal and intention of the program

The overarching goal of the CEO Shadow program is to give [eligible teammates](ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility) broad exposure to every possible facet of the business while working directly with the CEO on a more personal level.

## What the CEO shadow program is NOT

The CEO Shadow program is not a professional or leadership development program. Being a CEO Shadow is not related to your performance (though, you must meet the [eligibility criteria](ceo-shadow-program.md#eligibility). Lastly, the CEO shadow program is not “extra work” on top of your core work. CEO Shadow rotations should be treated as paid leave by their department and the teammate.

## Typical responsibilities

As the Shadow CEO, you will have unprecedented access to the CEO / exec team and be exposed to confidential and proprietary information. CEO Shadows must honor the confidentiality of content, topics, and information being discussed.

Additionally, CEO Shadows are expected to do more than just "tag along". The expectation is the CEO Shadow will meaningfully contribute to conversations, meetings, content development, program / projects, etc. as they are able.

Examples of typical tasks and responsibilities of a CEO Shadow:

- Provide a “bottoms-up” perspective as you openly, thoughtfully, and respectfully observe, challenge, and collaborate with the CEO and exec team on company business.
- Help craft weekly priorities for the CEO
- Take notes (as directed) and follow up on action items, decisions, etc. from the meetings you attend
- Record an external-facing video / blog post on your experience to help with recruitment, company brand, etc.
- Train / enable new CEO Shadows for their upcoming rotation.

## Eligibility & Participation

### Eligibility

All Sourcegraph teammates in good standing (not on a performance plan) are eligible for the CEO Shadow Program.

### Participation

The CEO Shadow Program typically lasts between 1-2 business days. The length and timing of the shadow program is subject to change given Quinn's and the Shadow's schedules. The CEO team will do it's best to keep agreed upon dates, with the understanding there are external factors that cause Quinn's availability to shift dramatically on a moment's notice.

This program is intended to be in-person and is a break from our async culture. However, given the [goal and intention](ceo-shadow-program.md#goal-and-intention-of-the-program) of the program, the CEO Shadow program should be an exception. Every effort will be made to ensure this program is inclusive. Please reach out to the CEO team, @connor o'brien (Chief of Staff to the CEO) or @sally voisen (Sr. EBP to the CEO) on slack if you have extenuating circumstances that are keeping you from participating in-person and we’ll do our best to accommodate.

Participation in the CEO Shadow Program is not additive work to your day job. Participating in the CEO Shadow program means you are taking a leave from your core job responsibilites to focus on being a CEO Shadow. Participation in the CEO Shadow program will not draw down from your available PTO as you will still be working, but in a different capacity.

## How to apply

1. Work with your manager and cross-reference [this doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqcXD5qZ6drKp1OEvGRM_o8tUuzydvzQJzcaOz-kMNs/edit#gid=0) to find a few dates that could work .
2. Once you've identified a few dates, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQXYDlypKgCEzGy8ifFFUuuLERRpSLKRFUGaoJgpsCUqU_QA/viewform) to kick off the request process.
3. The Sr. Executive Business Partner to the CEO (@sally voisen on slack) will then reach out to coordinate and schedule your rotation date(s) and discuss program logistics (where to stay, when to arrive, what to expect, etc.). Most answers to these questions should be answered on this handbook page. If they are not, please don't hesitate to reach out for clarification.

## Preparation

We encourage upcoming Shadows to review prior shadows [blogs / vlogs](ceo-shadow-program.md#past-ceo-shadow-experiences) or reach out to them directly to discuss their experience. You can also reach out to the CEO team, @connor o'brien (Chief of Staff to the CEO) or @sally voisen (Sr. EBP to the CEO). (They will also proactively reach out to you if there is anything specific Quinn would like to work with you on.)

### Travel & Expenses

The CEO Shadow Program is designed to provide a unique and compelling opportunity to any and all Sourcegraph teammates. Its goal is to be as inclusive as possible so any and all travel-related expenses (detailed below) will be covered by the program and not draw down from your [individual travel budget](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel/index.md).

**NOTE:** Quinn's calendar is very fluid. CEO Shadows should not expect to finalize their air travel and hotel until at least 1-2 weeks before their scheduled rotation. We understand this makes planning difficult, but the Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) will do their best to confirm Quinn's schedule as soon as possible to minimize disruption.

#### Lodging

Lodging during the CEO shadow program is provided by the company and will only cover for the "active" shadowing period. If traveling a long distance and lodging is needed beyond the rotation, please clear it with the Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) first.

Lodging is booked in accordance with our [company travel policy](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel/index.md). We use Navan.

We typically suggest CEO Shadows stay in San Francisco, but CEO Shadows should work with the Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) on where to stay to minimize travel and expense based on Quinn's calendar.

#### Airfare

Airfare is booked in accordance with our [company travel policy](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel/index.md). We use Navan.

#### Transportation to / from the airport

At San Francisco International airport (SFO), all rideshare apps (Uber, Lyft, etc) pick up on level 5 of the parking structure. Taxis [pick up on the Arrivals/Baggage Claim Level](https://www.flysfo.com/content/taxis#:~:text=Taxis%20depart%20from%20the%20designated,passengers%20with%20questions%20or%20concerns.) for all terminals. The [BART](https://www.bart.gov/) (Bay Area Rapid Transit / our local metro / train) also runs from [SFO to San Francisco](https://www.bart.gov/schedules).

#### Expensing meals

CEO Shadows should follow our [company travel policy](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/travel/index.md) in regards to food and dining. The Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) will work with the finance team to enable the correct spend category in Airbase for you to submit expenses against.

#### Childcare

Childcare is covered during the active shadowing period and will be reimbursed via your expense report. The Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) will work with the finance team to enable the correct spend category in Airbase for you to submit expenses against.

#### Required Business Travel

The CEO shadow will accompany the CEO on any and all business travel.

## Off-sites and Board Meetings

The CEO Shadow will not participate in Exec Team off-site or Board meetings. Should your proposed dates fall within one of those events, the Sr. EBP to the CEO (@sally voisen) will work with you on identifying alternative dates for your rotation.

## Blog post / interview

Part of your job as a CEO Shadow is to create a blog / vlog post about your time as the CEO Shadow.
