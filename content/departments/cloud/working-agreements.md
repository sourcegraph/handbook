# Cloud Team Working Agreements

Guidelines for how the [Cloud team](./index.md) collaborates.

## Roles of Cloud teammates

- [Cloud Engineer](#cloud-engineer)
- [Cloud EM and PM](#cloud-em-and-pm)
- [DRI](#dri)
- [On-call Engineer](#on-call-engineer)
- [Security Engineer](#security-engineer)

## Issue tracking

The [Cloud team GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/264/views/1) is the single source of truth.

## Project planning

### How do we work on projects?

Aside from ad-hoc and support tasks, our work is usually considered as part of an initiative. This section will walk through the process of how to discover, plan, scope, estimate and prepare the work for execution. At a high level, every initiative is considered a project; every [project](#project-initiative) consists of multiple [milestones](#milestone); each milestone consists of many [tasks](#task).

For example, below is the mental model to approach a project to add support for a new region to Cloud:

> Adding new region support to Cloud is the project. Usually, the first milestone would be performing discovery work. In this case, this could be quickly putting a working deployment (proof of concept, or POC) in the new region. After the discovery, it provides a better idea of what needs to be done. The second milestone would be to properly define the scope and break them down to multiple milestones for execution. This could be presented in the form of a RFC or some other document and it should be peer reviewed by the team or relevant stakeholders. Such document should meet the requirement of [Definition of Ready](#definition-of-ready) prior to execution. The project should also meet the requirement of [Definition of Done](#definition-of-done) to be considered as finished.

### How do we update project status?

> this is the high-level structure of how we work on a project and we are still figuring out the standardized way of issue tracking, e.g. what tool to use.

The DRI is expected to provide weekly update (TBD) in #cloud. For every ongoing project, the DRI should provide update on the current milestone using the following questionnaire

- which initiativemilestone?
- which milestone?
- what is the status? green, yellow, or red
- what is the significant progress?
- what do you plan on working next week? (Optional)

Status update on the project-level is up to EM. #cloud EM will aggregate status of all ongoing projects and broadcast with the organization.

## On-call (support) rotation

We maintain an [on-call rotation in Opsgenie](https://sourcegraph.app.opsgenie.com/teams/dashboard/9ec2825d-38da-4e2b-bdec-a0c03d11d420/main). Responsibilities of the teammate who is on-call include:

- Acknowledging incoming alerts
- Initiating incident procedures
- Publishing postmortems

On-call engineers are explicitly empowered to work on reliability issues and other high priority work while on-call.
This is a critical part of the role and is expected to be a significant portion of the on-call engineer's time.
The on-call engineer is expected to be available to respond to alerts and to initiate incident procedures.

This means that an on-call engineer has the ability BUT IS NOT REQUIRED to work on tasks that improve the reliability of Sourcegraph Cloud.
Examples include work right-sizing instances to reduce the number of alerts. They may choose to work on these tasks instead of their assigned work.

## Communication

- #cloud - external channel for the Cloud team where other Sourcegraphers can ask for help or leave questions for the team
- #cloud-internal - internal channel for the Cloud team for all day to day communication within the team

## Glossary

### Project (Initiative)

A project represents bodies of work for stakeholders and non-involved teammates. A project should demonstrate business values to staksholders. A project is owned by DRI or the subgroup. A project should be served as the interface between #cloud and the rest of the organization.

### Milestone

A milestone tracks progress towards the completion of a project. Each milestone should demonstrate meaningful progress. Each milestone should provide value to the stakeholders. It should also have a **fixed scope** to avoid neverending project, and it should always have a **deadline**. Milestone should be served as the interface between DRI and the rest of the team. Therefore, milestone progress should be included in the weekly status update within the team.

### Task

A task is the smallest unit of work that we peform. DRI has the final say on how the task is structured and performed. Teammates outside of the subgroup are not expected to keep track of individual tasks.

Tasks are typically tracked as issues in [GitHub Projects](#issue-tracking).

### Definition of Ready

The Definition of Ready (DoR) is a list of criteria that the high level initiative definition (exp. an epic) should meet in order to be ready for scoping down into individual GitHub issues:

- [Context and objectives](#context-and-objectives)
- [High-level plan](#high-level-plan)
- [Estimates](#estimates)

Each item should be assessed at each DRI's discretion.

#### Context and objectives

- Context behind project
  - Research on alternatives
  - Risks of not pursuing the initiative
  - Reasons to not pursue the initiative
- Objective of project
  - Business impact
  - Value to customers
  - How to measure impact and value
- External and internal dependencies
- List of stakeholders
- RFC or written document explaining the above

#### High-level plan

- Fixed scope, clear deliverables
- Milestones and plan for the work
  - MVP definition
  - Rollout plan
- Security risk level assessment and approval if required
- Impact assessment timelines

#### Estimates

- Cost projection
- Engineering capacity required estimate

### Definition of Done

The Definition of Done (DoD) is a list of criteria that the high level initiative definition (exp. an epic) _should_ meet in order to be considered DONE:

- [Work is completed](#work-is-completed)
- [Documentation is available](#documentation-is-available)
- [Approvals](#approvals)
- [Operability](#operability)

Each item should be assessed at each DRI's discretion.

#### Work is completed

- No more work required from the Cloud team
- Fully tested (unit/integration/scale/load/performance testing)
- Rolled out to applicable instances
- Future work tracked as issues

##### Documentation is available

- User-facing documentation
- Customer-facing documentation
- Enablement and training material for CE/sales
- [Operability](#operability) documentation

#### Approvals

#### Operability

Operational plans:

- Rollout plan
- Feature flagging/rollback plans
- Monitoring/observability plan
- Impact/correctness measurement plan
- Cost assessment and verification plan

Operational knowledge:

- On-call playbooks, troubleshooting/operational documentation
