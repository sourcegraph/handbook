# Working agreements

Guidelines for how the [Cloud team](./index.md) collaborates. Also see [How we work](./index.md#how-we-work).

## Definition of Ready

The Definition of Ready (DoR) is a list of criteria that the high level initiative definition (exp. an epic) should meet in order to be ready for scoping down into individual GitHub issues:

- [Context and objectives](#context-and-objectives)
- [High-level plan](#high-level-plan)
- [Estimates](#estimates)

Each item should be assessed at each DRI's discretion.

### Context and objectives

- Context behind project
  - Research on alternatives
  - Risks of not pursuing the initiative
  - Reasons to not pursue the initiative
- Objective of project
  - Business impact
  - Value to customers
  - How to measure impact and value
- External and internal dependencies
- List of stakeholders
- RFC or written document explaining the above

### High-level plan

- Fixed scope, clear deliverables
- Milestones and plan for the work
  - MVP definition
  - Rollout plan
- Security risk level assessment and approval if required
- Impact assessment timelines

### Estimates

- Cost projection
- Engineering capacity required estimate

## Definition of Done

The Definition of Done (DoD) is a list of criteria that the high level initiative definition (exp. an epic) _should_ meet in order to be considered DONE:

- [Work is completed](#work-is-completed)
- [Documentation is available](#documentation-is-available)
- [Approvals](#approvals)
- [Operability](#operability)

Each item should be assessed at each DRI's discretion.

### Work is completed

- No more work required from the Cloud team
- Fully tested (unit/integration/scale/load/performance testing)
- Rolled out to applicable instances
- Future work tracked as issues

### Documentation is available

- User-facing documentation
- Customer-facing documentation
- Enablement and training material for CE/sales
- [Operability](#operability) documentation

### Approvals

- Security approval
- Legal and compliance approval
- Stakeholder sign-off (e.g. external team, CE engineers, etc)

### Operability

Operational plans:

- Rollout plan
- Feature flagging/rollback plans
- Monitoring/observability plan
- Impact/correctness measurement plan
- Cost assessment and verification plan

Operational knowledge:

- On-call playbooks, troubleshooting/operational documentation
- Cloud team knowledge sharing focused on operator maintainence and future dev work (e.g. with docs or walkthroughs)
- Launch questionnaire or playbook
