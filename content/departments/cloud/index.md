# Cloud Operations Team

> [!NOTE] **Cloud means single-tenant dedicated instances managed by Sourcegraph** _(for example `mycompany.sourcegraph.com`)_. Sourcegraph Cloud should not be confused with Sourcegraph.com which holds public and open source code. The Cloud and managed instance should be considered synonyms within these handbook pages.

The Cloud team is the special focus team reporting directly to CEO modeled on _‚Äúif AWS were to offer ‚ÄòManaged Sourcegraph‚Äô like they do Elasticsearch, Redis, PostgreSQL, etc., how would they do it?‚Äù_ The team is responsible for maintaining existing [managed instances](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/managed) and building the next generation of them. The Cloud team has no other responsibilities.

## Mission statement

Build a **fully managed platform** for using Sourcegraph, providing **feature compatibility** with self-hosted while **being cost-efficient for customers and Sourcegraph**.

**Fully managed**

- Observability allowing Sourcegraph to react before user impact is noticed, while respecting user privacy
- Frequent, invisible Sourcegraph upgrades
- Invisible infrastructure updates
- Zero infrastructure access for customers

**Platform**

- Low customer onboarding cost
- Zero customer maintenance cost
- Secure (SOC 2, documented security posture)
- Reliable (ability to offer SLA, internal SLO of 99.9%)
- Automatable (in due time, feature releases / billing / upgrades / analytics are built-in)

**Feature compatibility**

- Feature set on-par (or more powerful) than self-hosted
- New features available on Cloud before self-hosted
- Existing features have higher adoption on Cloud than self-hosted

**Cost-efficiency**

- Infrastructure cost covered by Sourcegraph
- Administration / operations provided by Sourcegraph
- (FY24) Self service provisioning / release channels for upgrades

#### Not in scope (for FY23 / FY24):

- supporting customer provided GCP infrastructure
- supporting cloud providers other than GCP
- managing Sourcegraph installations in clusters not provisioned by the Cloud team (Bring-your-own-Kubernetes)
- supporting customers smaller than [X1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJq_-arjzjsBDFWV5VlHi01KrxTXYd8NV5UV-fmMtCE/edit#bookmark=id.kjizf2bpwb0f) ARR
- optimizing cost below [X2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJq_-arjzjsBDFWV5VlHi01KrxTXYd8NV5UV-fmMtCE/edit#bookmark=id.pqt5n89wdcan) $/month

## How to contact the team and ask for help

- For emergencies and incidents, alert the team using Slack command `/genie alert [message] for cloud` and optionally tag the `@cloud-support` handle.
- For internal Sourcegraph teammates, join us in #discuss-cloud-ops slack channel to ask questions or request help from our team.
- For [managed instance requests](#managed-instance-requests) or requests for help that requires action for the Cloud team engineers _(exp. coding, infrastructure change etc.)_ please create a GH issue and assign a `team/cloud` label. You can also post a follow up message on the #cloud slack channel
- You may tag the `@cloud-support` handle if you are looking for immediate attention, and it will notify our [on-call engineers](#on-call). Please avoid tagging/DM a specific teammate or the `@cloud-team` handle.

## Cloud Instances

### When to offer a Cloud Instance

> [!NOTE] Please first read [the customer-facing managed instance documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/managed) to understand what managed instances are and what we provide.

See below for the SLAs and Technical implementation details (including Security) related to managed instances.

Please message [`#discuss-cloud-ops`](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C03JR7S7KRP) for any answers or information missing from this page.

When offering customers a Cloud Instance, CE and Sales should communicate and gather information for the following topics

- Customers are comfortable with [security implication](technical-docs/index.md#security) of using a managed instance
- Customers' code host should be accessible publically or able to allow incoming traffic from Sourcegraph-owned static IP addresses. _(Notes: we do not have GA support for other connectivity methods, e.g. site-to-site VPN)_

## Supporting Manage Instance

### SLAs for managed instances

Support SLAs for Sev 1 and Sev 2 can be found [here](../technical-success/support/index.md#slas). Other engineering SLAs are listed below

> SLA for internal requests may be extended during upstream service providers outage. For example, automated trial instance creation workflow relies on GitHub Actions and GitHub is down.

### Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective (RTO & RPO)

We have a maximum Recovery Point Objective of 24 hours. Snapshots are performed at-least daily on managed instances. Some components may have lower RPOs (e.g. database).

Our maximum Recovery Time Objective is defined by our [support SLAs](../technical-success/support/index.md#slas) for P1 & P2 incidents.

### Incident Response

Incidents which affect managed instances are handled according to our [incidents](../engineering/dev/process/incidents/index.md) process.

### Accessing/Debugging Managed Instances

For information relating to accessing, debugging, or otherwise admnistrating a managed instance, please refer to the go/cloud-ops.

## Processes

- [Cloud team working agreements](./working-agreements.md)
- [Cloud launch process](./launch-process.md)
- [Technical documentation](technical-docs/index.md)
- [Post Mortem Template / RCA](cloud-rca.md)

## FAQ

### FAQ: Can customers disable the "Builtin username-password authentication"?

Yes, you may disable the builtin authentication provider and only allow creation of accounts from configured SSO providers.

[Sourcegraph teammate access to Cloud instances](technical-docs/oidc_site_admin.md) is configured separately at the infrastructure and lives outside the regular Sourcegraph site configuration.

### FAQ: How do I restart the frontend after changing the site-config?

> [!NOTE] If you are a Cloud teammate, follow the regular operation playbook.

To restart the frontend for a customer, you can either execute:

#### Automated (recommended)

1. Navigate to the [Reload Instance Frontend](https://github.com/sourcegraph/cloud/actions/workflows/mi_reload_frontend.yml) GitHub Actions page
1. Click the "Run Workflow" button
1. Enter in the customer slug and select `prod` as the environment. If you do not know the slug, refer to the `Name` field of the table at http://go/cloud-ops.

#### Manually (requires [Cloud V2 Prod Access](https://app.entitle.io/request?bundleId=ce56e0e6-15d6-4f3a-93df-dd2418d378ec&targetType=bundle))

```sh
mi2 instance workon -e prod -s <customer slug> -exec
mi2 instance check pods-health
kubectl rollout restart deployments/sourcegraph-frontend
```

### FAQ: Do you support custom domains?

Yes. Learn more about [custom domain support](./technical-docs/custom_domain.md).

### FAQ: Does Cloud support Server Side Batch Changes and precise code navigation?

Yes. All Cloud instances have executors enabled by default, enabling the use of Server Side Batch Changes and Code Intel auto-indexing.

Key facts:

- [SSBC](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/explanations/server_side) is enabled by default
- [Auto-indexing](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_navigation/explanations/auto_indexing) are enabled on all repos by default so customer can benefit from [precise code navigation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_navigation/explanations/precise_code_navigation). However, this relies on [inference](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_navigation/explanations/auto_indexing_inference) to work on the customer repo. For unsupported repo or repo that uses private registry (e.g., private NPM), the customer will have to work with Support or #ask-code-intel to figure out the custom auto-indexing configuration.

### FAQ: What are Cloud plans for observability - can I see data from customer instances in Honeycomb / Grafana Cloud / X?

Cloud instances provisioned for customers provide the same monitoring data / tooling as all other Sourcegraph instances (Grafana/Prometheus for metrics, Jaeger for traces).
GCP Logging is used to store / query logs written by Sourcegraph workloads, and GCP Monitoring is used for infrastructure-level metrics / uptime checks.

Access to data from Cloud instances is governed by [Cloud Access Control Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16tRqZDKhli4hZtfAkJG46Cj6dtqAw2s6QGw5fGM43BQ/edit?usp=sharing).

Long-term, we will collaborate with [Developer Infrastructure team](../engineering/teams/devinfra/index.md) (as owners of Sourcegraph observability) to support monitoring / observability solutions that are qualified for use with customer data.

### FAQ: What are Cloud plans for continuous deployment - how often do we deploy code to Cloud instances?

Cloud instances provisioned for customers run [released](../engineering/dev/process/releases/index.md#releases) Sourcegraph versions and are currently updated at least once a month (for minor releases), unless we need to deploy a patch release.

Sourcegraph-owned instances can opt-in to receive continuous upgrades with versions that weren't officially released, e.g., the latest commit on `main` branch, release branches. We own continuous deployment to those environments.

### FAQ: What are Cloud plans for analytics - where can I see data from Cloud instances in Looker / Amplitude?

Cloud instances do not expose analytics data other than [pings](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/pings).
Future work in this area is owned by [Data & Analytics team](../data-analytics/index.md).

### FAQ: Does Cloud support data migrations?

Cloud instances are generally created without any customer data (repos / code-host connections / code / user accounts / code insights etc.).

The Cloud team has an experimental process for importing data from on-premises / jointly-managed Sourcegraph instances, described [here](technical-docs/v2.0/onprem_data_migration.md).

### FAQ: How do I generate a password reset link for customer admin?

> For #cloud engineers, run `mi reset-customer-password -email <>` and it will generate a 1password share link for you.

The password reset link expires after 24h, so it's quite common that CE would have to generate a new link during the initial hand-off process.

If access to the instance is restricted, either via VPN or CIDR whitelist, please reach out to #cloud for assistance.

Otherwise, the CE responsible for the customer is added as site-admin, so CE can login with "Sourcegraph Employee" (Google Workspace) auth provider and reset customer admin password. Otherwise, please reach out to #cloud for assistance.

**IMPORTANT**: Please do not share the password reset url directly with the customer admin over email or slack. [More context](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C03JR7S7KRP/p1660037049746969).

Open 1password, and create a new Secure Note item and paste the password reset url, then use the [1password share item feature](https://support.1password.com/share-items/) to securely share the link with customer admin. Make sure you configure the following options while sharing the item:

- Link expires after: 1 day
- Available to: `<insert customer admin email>`

This ensures only the customer admin is able to gain access to the password reset url.

### FAQ: I have a new feature I want to deploy to Cloud, how do I do that?

Read through our [Cloud Cost Policy](cloud-cost.md)

### FAQ: What is the Cloud instance IP?

Use cases:

- The customer wants to maintain an IP allowlist to permit traffic to their code hosts
- The customer wants to maintain an IP allowlist to permit the use of their own SMTP service.
- The customer wants to permit Cloud instance access to their private registry for [code navigation auto-indexing](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_navigation/how-to/enable_auto_indexing), e.g, NPM Enterprise, [JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/).
- The customer wants to use container images from a private container registry in build steps during auto-indexing or SSBC.
- The customer wants to communicate directly with private resources in [server-side batch changes](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/batch_changes/explanations/server_side).

**Outgoing** traffic of Cloud instances goes through Cloud NAT with stable IPs. All IPs are reserved exclusively on a per-customer basis. Those IPs are used by Sourcegraph Cloud to communicate directly with customer systems such as code hosts, authentication service, or SMTP service.

For #ce teammates, please review above content and reach out to #cloud with sufficient context.

For #cloud teammates, please run follow the operation dashboard.

### FAQ: Can customers restrict access to their Cloud instances to VPN-only/specific IP adddresses?

Use cases:

- The customer would like to only permit access to the Cloud instance from their VPN

**Incoming** traffic of Cloud instances first go through our WAF provider, Cloudflare, and we are able to utilize Cloudflare to filter incoming traffic based on the IP list provided by customer.

For #ce teammates, please request a list of IP address of IP ranges (CIDR) from customers and include them in the creation request.

For #cloud teammates, add the IP addresses to the instance `config.yaml`.

### FAQ: What code-hosts does Cloud support?

Cloud supports all code-hosts types (self-managed and Cloud-managed), but it currently requires the code-host to have a public IP.
More context [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14S3jn0bV03WdeT1H36omvtGJFoIFJjM-3ZA1qIyIl7o/edit).

If your prospect have the need for private code hosts, please reach out to #discuss-cloud-ops, and we would love to partner with them to develop a solution.

### FAQ: What is the difference between air-gapped, private and public code hosts?

- **Air-Gapped Code Host** is a code host that is physically isolated from the internet. For example the code host is deployed on a hardware (server) that is within customers office/private data center and the only way to connect to this code host is to be physically connected to this air-gapped network; a user has to be within the office and be connected to the air-gapped office network via ethernet cable of wi-fi. In this scenario the only option for Sourcegraph to work is on-prem deployment within the same air-gapped network and all users connect to Sourcegraph instance via local IP or local DNS. _Please note cloud will never be able to support air-gapped code hosts as these are based on their physical isolation so it‚Äôs not technically feasible for a Cloud instance to access such code host._
- **Private Code Host** is a code host deployed in a private network (for example AWS EC2 instance within VPC). To connect to this code host a user has to have access to the private network usually via VPC Peering, VPN, or tunneling)
- **Public Code Host** is the code host that is publicly accessible on internet - a user can CURL it via IP or open the URL in the browser. This also includes a code host with a public interface but restricts access to IP allowlist. The Sourcegraph instance can access this code host without using VPC Peering, VPN or other methods. Of course, accessing this code host is protected by authentication and authorization mechanisms

### FAQ: How do I figure out the GCP Project ID for a customer?

To identify the Project ID for a given customer, refer to the table found at http://go/cloud-ops.
