## UTM Tracking

Sourcegraph uses UTM parameters to understand the source of online traffic to our various sites and products. This data is useful for understanding which sources are best at driving traffic / awareness and informs our marketing investment strategy. All external links to Sourcegraph web properties should include UTM parameters for medium, source, campaign, and content. Examples of content that should include UTM parameters: links to our product in a LinkedIn feed post, a Google paid search ad linking to our homepage, etc.

[UTM.io](https://web.utm.io) is our internal tool for building webpage links with correct conventions for UTMs. If you do not have access to the Sourcegraph workspace, please request it on Slack. New links can be created using the Create Link button in the top left of the Links sub-page. Currently, values for UTM medium and UTM source are restricted to values aligning with this [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xKusTq98rHWtv1N_5t4FhF-f7OAXnH3GXj9zloA7P9k/edit#gid=435040517). If there is a value for either field you feel is missing, please post your requested medium and source values in the #ask-sales-ops channel and we will add them. Multiple Hubspot workflows are dependent on these values, so this standardization ensures all dependencies continue to properly function.
