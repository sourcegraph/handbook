### My view on demand generation

Demand Gen is great because it impacts growth through many different tools: storytelling, analytics, creativity, messaging, tooling, processes, and more. It also creates a lot of opportunities for cross-functional work in a business. It's something you have to stragecially think about, and something you have to be creative about.

### Preferred learning styles

I learn a bunch of different ways—but the most effective is the following process: hearing it, then reading it, and then doing it. In meetings I am looking generally for context. I digest information best from reading it, I retain info by doing it.

### Communication style

My brain works in a non-linear way; so when I am in a meeting, I am thinking of 100 random different ways to do something. Sometimes in the moment it is hard for me to reach up in my mind and articulate the universe of thoughts I have on a subject. I sometimes will talk out my thoughts, which is helpful but it's not always the right time to do that. I can seem quiet in meetings, this is because I am likely processing the info and my thoughts on it. It doesn't mean I don't have an input, it's just I am making sure I understand the presenter and myself. It's best for me to think, then stop to organize and articulate what I am thinking. Writing things out is usually my best way articulating ideas/strategy etc.. However, I love talking and listening for context on why and what?
If there is ever any tension or any type of conflict, I much prefer talking in person.

### Preferred way to collaborate

I like to work with people,sharing ideas verbally, brainstorming sessions, google docs, defined roles, it's all good.

### How I approach problems

-Gather information and context.

-Give my brain a chance to think about problem without structure.

-Write down my structure and plan of approach.

-Begin to solve problem.

-Iterate.

-Learn.

-Solve.

-Loop.

### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

I was the kid that when I scored a goal in little league soccer i'd be trying so hard to not show that I was smiling, I tried to play it cool. However, it was super obvious how stoked I was. I like to know when I have hit a home run, but I don't always know how to react. It's also important for me to hear and feel that someone genuinely is appreciative of something I have done. I also like to tell people how much help they have given me and what they mean to me as well.

### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

I don't mind asking for help, and really hope people ask for help from me when they need it.

### What I find enjoyable at work

-Spending time working with teammates.

-When I figure out something hard techincally.

-When I am able to sit down and focus on a problem.

-Learning about what people are focused on, understanding the context and story behind the numbers I get to pull.

### What kind of work do I find easiest to do

Brainstorming and working with people to determine what is needed, also find building dashboards easy.

### How do I feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for me to see and respond to during active hours

I prefer not to work at night or on the weekends. However; when it is needed, I am more than happy to make sure something gets done. Feel free to communicate whenever, I am not shy to ask if something needs to be done right away or if it can wait. If it's a easy quick answer, I don't mind answering it.

### How folks can best show up for me when I seem off

Ask me whats going on? Talking to someone about whatever usually helps me,getting some reassurance is usally pretty helpful. I can be hard on myself. You can also ask me if I've been to yoga recently, cause if not I may seem off.

### Things I am aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

When I feel like I don't fully understand something and I am expected to all the sudden build a dashboard! Or when a dashboard is the answer to everyone's problems. Don't get me wrong, love dashboards—just sometimes I feel like it becomes a crutch or isn't thought out.
