## Sales Performance Goals

Sales performance goals are an important tool used to provide clear direction, celebrate wins, identify areas for improvement, and help with the prioritization of enablement and resources.

**Why do we provide individual contributors with performance goals?**

* **Transparency**: performance goals give clear direction to teammates on what they need to achieve to be successful and continuously grow in their careers. This helps teammates focus their efforts on what is important, understand how performance is evaluated, and prioritize their work.
* **Continuously grow:** performance goals help identify areas for improvement and how we can all continue to ‘level up’. If a teammate is not tracking against key performance goals, it could be an indication that they need more coaching, training, or support in specific areas.
* **Celebrate success:** help measure ‘what good looks like’  by tracking progress against these key performance indicators. Beyond celebrating when we bring on new clients, we also want to highlight all the work that goes into achieving this and the many smaller wins that occur across the year.

**What are we measuring?** 

Goals will be measured on a quarterly basis and are based on key performance indicators aligned to each respective quota-carrying role. Please see the outline below

### Account Executive Goals:

Please reference this Salesforce [report](https://sourcegraph2020.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Dashboard/01Z5b000001QLr1EAG/view?queryScope=userFolders) as the ‘source of truth for goal attainment

#### Definitions:



* **Closed Won:** This measures execution at the expected attainment level and is used to track the performance in terms of successfully closing deals. 
* **Weighted Pipeline:** This is used to measure the effectiveness in running the sales process, identify areas for improvement, and forecast the potential revenue to ensure the individual is tracking toward revenue attainment. The weighted pipeline is calculated as follows:
    * Stage 1 - 0%
    * Stage 2 - 10%
    * Stage 3 - 20%
    * Stage 4 - 50%
    * Stage 5 - 75%
    * Stage 6 - 90%
* **New Logos:** This will be measured by SAO pipeline in a given quarter and is used to measure the progress of new client acquisition in alignment with our ‘fast-start’ GTM strategy. New Logos as defined in the blue box below. The focus on New Logos is consistent with the FY24 strategy.

### What happens if I’m not tracking toward my goals?

If a teammate is not tracking toward their expected performance goals there are several potential opportunities as to how we support them to ensure they are set up for success and continue to grow their career at Sourcegraph!


* **Coaching and training:** Our goal is to ensure that all teammates receive continuous coaching; however, if there is a consistent gap in goal execution, the teammate may receive additional formal coaching and training to help them improve their performance and meet their goals. _The expectation is that at any given time during the Quarter, top performing Reps will be at 100% of each of the weighted targets. Managers will engage in active coaching with Reps who are not meeting at least two of their weighted targets at any time during the Quarter._
* **Performance improvement plan:** If a teammate is consistently not delivering after continued coaching and training guidance, they may be placed on a performance improvement plan, which outlines specific areas for improvement and provides a timeline for meeting the expected performance goals. Additional PIP guidance can be found [here](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/company-info-and-process/working-at-sourcegraph/teammate-development/#addressing-underperformance). 

Performance benchmarks are used to ensure expectations are communicated effectively and that all teammates are held to the same standards. We recognize that as a company, we _must_ provide sufficient support and resources to help sales teammates improve their performance and meet their goals whenever possible, which is why these additional guidelines will be helpful in prioritizing coaching, training, and investment in resources for the team and measuring the success of these in enabling the teammate’s ability to hit their goals.
