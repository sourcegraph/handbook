## Role Requirements

### SFDC Hygiene

1. Close Dates:

   - When setting up an opportunity it should be the 1st day two months out; any opp opened in February will having a starting close date of April 1st.
     - A close date on the 1st implies that your best guess is that the close date will be either 30 days before or after this date.
     - A close date on the 1st implies that you don’t have alignment with the customer on the close date timing.
     - This date is easily moved.
   - Once you have alignment with the customer, you may move the close date to the last day of the month you believe the deal will close.
     - This date should push <10% of the time
     - You may move this date forward to the actual day a deal closes if it is before the last day of the month when you have closed/won the deal.

2. Next Steps:

   - Update the next steps date after each meeting. This should always be kept up-to-date.
   - The next step spells out the next customer interaction. Is it a follow up call? Are you sending collateral? Will you meet for a demo? Will you meet to discuss business value? Is it a negotiation?
   - Always keep the next steps date updated

3. About the 3 Why’s:
   - Why anything: this is a description of the customer’s business problem; this should be something quantifiable in terms of time or money or pertaining to security
   - Why Sourcegraph: this describes the technical problems that underlie the business problem and how Sourcegraph is uniquely suited to solving these technical problems
   - Why now: this may come later in discovery but it gives purpose for a timeline / compelling event

## Best Practices

### Meetings

1. Before the first meeting:

   - If the deal was sourced by an SDR or other introduction, make sure to have a sit down before the meeting to incorporate whatever information the deal sourcer has for you.
   - Prep a deck with the customer logo on it.
     - Include a Sourcegraph overview with the slides you’d like to use to tell the Sourcegraph story
     - The important questions:
       - What questions do you want to ask every customer? Maybe these should be on a standardized slide.
       - What questions or comments do you have for this particular customer?

2. After the first meeting:

   - Does the customer have a valuable problem they want to solve and are they willing to work with you via a planned next step to solve it?
     - If so, send an calendar invite with an agenda for the next meeting
     - If not, kick it back to the SDR to schedule any additional meetings that may subsequently create a SAO

3. After every meeting:
   - Schedule 30 minutes after the call customer calls because:
     - They are cushion should the call run over.
     - It is time for you to debrief with your SDR, CE and any other support on the call.
     - Update your notes and SFDC.
     - Execute your next steps, calendar invite, summary email and agenda etc.
