## Role Requirements
### SFDC Hygiene
1. Close Dates:
   - When setting up an opportunity it should be the 1st day two months out; any opp opened in February will having a starting close date of April 1st.
     - A close date on the 1st implies that your best guess is that the close date will be either 30 days before or after this date.
     - A close date on the 1st implies that you don’t have alignment with the customer on the close date timing.
     - This date is easily moved.
   - Once you have alignment with the customer, you may move the close date to the last day of the month you believe the deal will close.
     - This date should push <10% of the time
     - You may move this date forward to the actual day a deal closes if it is before the last day of the month when you have closed/won the deal.

2. Next Steps:
   - Update the next steps date after each meeting. This should always be kept up-to-date.
   - The next step spells out the next customer interaction. Is it a follow up call? Are you sending collateral? Will you meet for a demo? Will you meet to discuss business value? Is it a negotiation?
   - Always keep the next steps date updated

3. About the 3 Why’s:
   - Why anything: this is a description of the customer’s business problem; this should be something quantifiable in terms of time or money or pertaining to security
   - Why Sourcegraph: this describes the technical problems that underlie the business problem and how Sourcegraph is uniquely suited to solving these technical problems
   - Why now: this may come later in discovery but it gives purpose for a timeline / compelling event
