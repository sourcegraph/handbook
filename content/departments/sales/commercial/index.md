## Role Requirements

### SFDC Hygiene

1. Close Dates:

   - When setting up an opportunity it should be the 1st day two months out; any opp opened in February will having a starting close date of April 1st.
     - A close date on the 1st implies that your best guess is that the close date will be either 30 days before or after this date.
     - A close date on the 1st implies that you don’t have alignment with the customer on the close date timing.
     - This date is easily moved.
   - Once you have alignment with the customer, you may move the close date to the last day of the month you believe the deal will close.
     - This date should push <10% of the time
     - You may move this date forward to the actual day a deal closes if it is before the last day of the month when you have closed/won the deal.

2. Next Steps:

   - Update the next steps date after each meeting. This should always be kept up-to-date.
   - The next step spells out the next customer interaction. Is it a follow up call? Are you sending collateral? Will you meet for a demo? Will you meet to discuss business value? Is it a negotiation?
   - Always keep the next steps date updated

3. About the 3 Why’s:
   - Why anything: this is a description of the customer’s business problem; this should be something quantifiable in terms of time or money or pertaining to security
   - Why Sourcegraph: this describes the technical problems that underlie the business problem and how Sourcegraph is uniquely suited to solving these technical problems
   - Why now: this may come later in discovery but it gives purpose for a timeline / compelling event

## Best Practices

### Meetings

1. Before the first meeting:

   - If the deal was sourced by an SDR or other introduction, make sure to have a sit down before the meeting to incorporate whatever information the deal sourcer has for you.
   - Prep a deck with the customer logo on it.
     - Include a Sourcegraph overview with the slides you’d like to use to tell the Sourcegraph story
     - The important questions:
       - What questions do you want to ask every customer? Maybe these should be on a standardized slide.
       - What questions or comments do you have for this particular customer?

2. After the first meeting:

   - Does the customer have a valuable problem they want to solve and are they willing to work with you via a planned next step to solve it?
     - If so, send an calendar invite with an agenda for the next meeting
     - If not, kick it back to the SDR to schedule any additional meetings that may subsequently create a SAO

3. After every meeting:
   - Schedule 30 minutes after the call customer calls because:
     - They are cushion should the call run over.
     - It is time for you to debrief with your SDR, CE and any other support on the call.
     - Update your notes and SFDC.
     - Execute your next steps, calendar invite, summary email and agenda etc.
   - If you send a calendar invite, make sure to include an agenda for the meeting.

### Mutual Action Plan

In stage 2 or 3, depending on how the deal is progressing it is important that you align with the customer on a [MAP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Whvi0HJBKlNDQqvhq1FXV9_flB_RVFHPPNil02h4Yd4/edit?usp=sharing). Unless a deal is in the "Fast Lane" it can not progress to stage 4 without a MAP. The mutual action plan should be formed in partnership with the champion. It is an agreement with the customer on predictable actions to be taken on the process toward a close. Expect no two customers to have the same process in place to complete a deal. A few items common on MAPs include:

    Trial training demo
    Trial decision criteria checkin
    Security review
    Legal review
    Business Value Analysis / Return on Investment
    Trial feedback survey
    Proposal for the executive team or executive buyer
    Final signature on the ELA
    Post sales support

### Return on Investment

In stage 3 or stage 4 you should put together a [ROI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Whvi0HJBKlNDQqvhq1FXV9_flB_RVFHPPNil02h4Yd4/edit?usp=sharing). The spreadsheet is a space to catalogue Sourcegraph's value for a customer. Unlesss a deal is in the "Fast Lane" it can not progress to stage 5 without a ROI. From the initial call with a customer your discovery should be executed with the intent to uncover value. Building an ROI gives purpose to questions like:

    Who (how many people) does the problem impact?
    What (how much time or money) is the cost of the problem?
    What if you don't do anything about the problem?
    How would Sourcegraph change your workflow?
    How much do these 3rd party tools cost?

## Day-to-Day Activities

### Order Forms

You can [get a walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17_bjpKrCp6y-KTby2fAgfP1bWT3IimI3/view) on where order forms are, how to fill them out, how to docusign the form and how to close a deal once you have a signed order.

If you need an exception to the norm for your order form, please see the [order form reviews](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xOFBtx3Me592fEVAp6SPDCosGtp--0fdVsaHPFx3SCs/edit?usp=sharing) document.

### Forecasting

1. Please complete forecasting by close of business on Friday.
2. Every week on Thursday you will receive an email with a title format as follows: **20XX-QX Your Name - Region Week X has not been completed. Please provide your updates.**
3. The notes should be staged as follows with headings of _Closed/Won_, _Commit_, _Call_, _Best Case_, and _Early Pipeline_.
   - For each heading include the total dollar amount for that heading; each subsequent heading is additive so the amount for "Commit" is additive of the deals in Commit and Close/Won
   - Put the title of the opp along with the amount of the opp under the heading
4. For efficiency, copy and paste notes from the week before and just add updates to the notes as is fitting.
5. How to determine stage:
   - Closed/Won is defined by business that has been Closed/Won in salesforce; I should not see these deals as open opps anymore
   - Commit means that you have switched the close date to the last day of the month that it will close in; these things are synonomous and you should not have one without the other
   - Call is for deals that you believe will come in during the quarter
     - this may apply to any deal that has a mutual action plan (MAP) where the close date is in quarter
     - the may apply to cloud deals that onboarded the month before the final month in the quarter
     - during the first month of the quarter, this should also apply to 1/3 of your existing pipeline for best case and early pipeline deals
   - Best Case are for deals that have engagement but without the clarity provided by a MAP; these deals may include those that you have a 'gut' feel for
   - Early Pipeline means that you're only a meeting or two in and you don't have strong engagmeent from the customer yet, many outbound deals will fall into this category early on; any deal that is not forecasted to close in quarter should fall into this category
6. Make sure to check your math. Closed/Won should have the smallest amount and Best Case should have the largest amount. Closed/Won to Best Case are all possibilities of what could happen within the quarter. Early Pipeline, by definition, is not forecasted for the quarter so you don't need to add the previous numbers up since the forecast is quarterly.
