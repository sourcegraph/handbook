# How and when to engage with security

### Security questionnaires

The CE team should take the first pass on inbound questionnaires using our [Knowledge Base](https://app.safebase.io/knowledge).

Once the first pass is done but questions remain open, please use the slack workflow **"Request Security Support"** in the #discuss-security slack channel.

> 💡 **Top Tip!** See the handbook page [here](../../security/security-trust-center.md) on how to access our Security Portal as an internal user.

### Customer security questions

If customers have specific security questions, first run them by the #ce slack channel. If nobody has context, or we're unsure of how to phrase things, follow the [guidance here](../../security/#how-to-work-with-us) to engage with the Security team.
