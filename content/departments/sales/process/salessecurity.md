# How and when to engage with security

### Security questionnaires

The CE team should take the first pass on inbound questionnaires using the [list of reference questionnaires](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11X8xoX9lK7aHY-UqZQIwQl_aQ8NQFu1D) we have collected in our shared drive and our "Knowledge Base" in our Security Trust Portal (https://app.safebase.io/knowledge).

Once the first pass is done, sign up for a security questionnaire review in [this signup sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6J8ZwPYDX-jJ0YU2l2CWXX3qboKD2XTbIeg5Q-NBAk/edit#).

> ðŸ’¡ **Top Tip!** Add a search engine to Chrome to specifically search the folder of reference questionnaires.
>
> 1. Go into the Chrome settings
> 2. Go to "Managed Search Engines"
> 3. Add a new one
> 4. Name it "Search security questionnaires", give it shortcut you'll remember, and a URL of `https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=parent:11X8xoX9lK7aHY-UqZQIwQl_aQ8NQFu1D%20%s`
> 5. Open a new tab and type your shortcut, then a space, then the search term you want to find!

### Customer security questions

If customers have specific security questions, first run them by the #ce slack channel. If nobody has context, or we're unsure of how to phrase things, follow the [guidance here](../../security/#how-to-work-with-us) to engage with the Security team.
