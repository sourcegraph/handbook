# How and when to engage with legal

- **Never talk to an attorney from a customer account without our legal present!**

### Conflict Check

Before any legal team involvement (such as reviewing an NDA or MSA), we need to check with our lawyers to see if they have any conflicts in advising us in negotiations with a customer.

A conflict check should be initiated for any first time customer if you are expecting any event that would require a legal review or by the time a deal reaches the "Contract Negotitiation" stage in Salesforce if no other event has occurred.

To initiate a conflict check draft and send a short email with the following information to our legal team:

> Please start a conflict check for the following company:
>
> Company Name
>
> Contact Name
>
> Type of Deployment [On-prem or Managed Instance]
>
> Potential Deal Size
>
> Special Business Terms
>
> Timeframe [Standard or Urgent]
