# CE Talent Review Process

Please note: the talent review process is independent of the recurring Impact Review process (more [here](../../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/index.md#commissions-and-bonuses).

## Cadence

The talent review process is performed in the first month of each fiscal quarter (February, May, August, November). Individuals who, at time of review, have been in their current band for a minimum of 4 quarters will be considered.
