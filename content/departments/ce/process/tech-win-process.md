# CE Management of the Technical Win

## Background

CEs are tightly aligned with the sales team and serve as technical experts, providing strategy and guidance to AEs during the sales cycle. Ultimately it is the CE that owns the “technical win” associated with an opportunity.

To be successful in driving technical wins requires the ability to:

1. Help define and document customers’ use cases as confirmed during the qualification stage of the sales process
2. Validate the technical viability of our solution against customers’ use cases using criteria provided by Product and Engineering
3. Understand how to leverage resources across the CE organization and other internal teams to secure the win
4. Track and communicate the technical win status with the sales organization and other teams in a way that aligns with Sourcegraph’s [company culture of remote and asynchronous](../../../company-info-and-process/communication/asynchronous-communication.md) communication

For the sales organization to scale effectively as our business grows, it needs to engage not only with opportunities that meet the [Target Opportunity Profile](../../sales/index.md#target-opportunity-profile) criteria as already defined. It also needs to understand whether or not a customer’s use cases can be met by our product based on a set of defined technical qualification criteria and customer-defined success criteria.
