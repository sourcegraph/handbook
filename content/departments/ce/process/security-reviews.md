# Responding to Customer Security Reviews

Often during a customerâ€™s technical validation process for our product, they will have security-related questions about either Sourcegraph or the manner in which Sourcegraph is deployed (Cloud, Managed Instance, Self-Hosted). In many cases, these questions are part of a larger security compliance process the customer runs to ensure they meet legal or regulatory requirements. As the primary owners of the technical win, CEs are responsible for collecting, researching and answering these questions on behalf of Sourcegraph.
