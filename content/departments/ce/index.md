# Customer Engineering

The Customer Engineering team at Sourcegraph is oriented around the technical success of our customers. CEs wear three hats: sales engineers, solution architects, and post-sales technical account managers. We are first and foremost responsible for building and fostering relationships with developer users and champions at our prospects and customers. We serve as the technical experts during the sales cycle and help enable our customers throughout our journey together by helping customers get more value from using Sourcegraph in more and better ways.

We show up for our customers, open source users, and teammates by living up to our Sourcegraph values and handbook, as well as in the following ways:

- We deeply know and understand our customers and their needs; we enable them and guide them
- We teach our customers new and better ways to get value from Sourcegraph as thought leaders and evangelists
- We serve as the voice of the customer to internal teams, providing key insights and feedback, and raising feature requests

## Why CE is both pre- and post-sales

CEs are both "pre-sales" and "post-sales" because the moment that a sale occurs doesn't usually change what our customers need from us. Most organizations have deployed Sourcegraph and rolled it out (sometimes widely, sometimes to a limited proof-of-concept group) by the time they become a paying customer. This is different from many other enterprise software products, where the software isn't actually used (for real) until the contract is signed. The continuity that CE provides means we give customers consistent and high-quality service and technical advocacy from the moment we meet them. We minimize handoffs, which is good for customers and helps our team take pride in seeing their work through.
