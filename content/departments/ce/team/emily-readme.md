## Emily Chapman

### My view on customer engineering

Being percieved as competent and friendly is 90% of the battle; customers don't care if you don't know things, but they care if you don't follow up when you say you will, or if you make things up. The relationship should be fundamentally collaborative.

### Preferred learning styles

I prefer to see videos of new features and read informaiton about them. I am the world's least visual learner.

### Communication style

Criticize in private, praise in public. I will always want to know the "why" behind a choice.

### Preferred way to collaborate

Give me a list of tasks you need from me and let me go off and produce a first draft that we can then iterate on. 

### Time of day where I’m most productive

Mornings.

### How I approach problems

My first question will always be what the end goal is in resolving the issue. Is there another way to meet the need? Is the problem actually a cover for a larger issue, given the goal?

### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

I prefer to have my ideas attributed to me if they're referenced elsewhere and to be praised in public if I've done public work.

### How to convince me to do something

Give me a clear "why"—how will the document I'm producing be used? What problem will an asset I'm writing solve? What is the long-term outcome that a training is driving?

### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

I will tend to directly reach out to people with whom I have a strong positive relationship in order to get help where I think their skills will be valuable. My feelings are not hurt if the answer is no.

### How I like to give and receive feedback

I try to be direct and stay focused on outcomes; I enjoy coaching people, particularly around public speaking and presentations. When recieving feedback, I'd rather recieve it early on before a problem grows than later on once it feels like I've been making a consistent mistake. I prefer to recieve feedback via writing.

### What I find enjoyable at work

Feeling like I am solving real problems for people whose work is valuable. 

### What kind of work do I find easiest to do when

I produce high-quality written content quickly, and am happiest when allowed to do so. I enjoy presenting to groups. 

### How do I feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for me to see and respond to during active hours

I don't have Slack on my phone and even if I did I have DND set on in my off hours. Message me whenever; I will ignore it until I'm back at work. (Team members can text me if a need is urgent; my phone number is in my Slack profile. I trust teammates not to abuse this.)

### How folks can best show up for me when I seem off

Asking how I am and clearly identifying why they're asking; taking tasks off my plate if they're in a position to do so.

### Things I am aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

Lack of feedback or recognition, use of my work without attribution, being left out of conversations where I feel that my input is relevant, having input discounted as "non-technical" even if relevant.

### Three things that bring me back to center when I’m stressed

Weight lifting, my cat, leaving work early.

### A pet peeve of mine

When suggestions are made without awareness of historical precedent. If an idea seems obvious and isn't being tried, it's more likely that there's context for why it's not happening than it is that someone is simply the first person to think of this new thing.

Also poor meeting management.

### My areas of knowledge

Customer support, REST API support, troubleshooting, SCIM, SAML, enterprise authentication, unicode, public speaking, cusotmer training, the sweet potato emoji.

### Areas of interest to learn

Containers.

### Current personal project

Trying to hit a 200 lbs squat.

### Something I fear

Making work a larger part of my life than warrented. 

### A quote I find powerful

"Let us stand by what is good and make it better if we can." - Atticus Greene Haygood

Also "But tonight he is alive and in the north/field with his mother. It is a perfect/summer evening: the moon rising over/the orchard, the wind in the grass. And/as he stares into the sky, there are/twice as many stars as usual." [always makes me cry](https://rolfpotts.com/two-headed-calf-by-laura-gilpin/).
