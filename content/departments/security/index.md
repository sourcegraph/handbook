We think that security is an enabler for the business. Sourcegraph is committed to proactive security, and addressing vulnerabilities in a timely manner. We approach security with a can-do philosophy, and look to achieve product goals while maintaining a positive posture, and improving our security stance over time.

## Members

{{generator:product_team.security}}

## Contact

We're here to help so reach out to us at [security@sourcegraph.com](mailto:security@sourcegraph.com) with any questions you may have. Sourcegraph employees can reach us in the #security Slack channel or tag us using @sourcegraph/security on GitHub.

Security questions and support requests should be raised in #security:

1. Click the lightning bolt below the Slack message box in #security
2. Select an option at the top of the menu
3. Fill out the questions
4. Tag @security-support in the resulting thread if urgent

### Security Questionnaires

Security questionnaires for new and existing customers should [follow the process here](../sales/process/salessecurity.md)‚Äîfeel free to message us on #security too.

Reach out to us on #security if you have any doubts, or for any reason feel like our process can't work for you in a particular case.

### Slack acknowledgement

It is essential to remove assumptions/uncertainty around whether teammates have seen, understood, or acted on a message in an async-first communication environment.
To assist in this regard, we provide the following guideline for teammates to follow when communicating and responding in Slack.

**The most important thing to remember is not which emoji to use, but rather to remember to acknowledge and do it unambiguously.**

_When acknowledging a request:_

- `:thumbsup:` (üëç) = I see the request and will action it
- `:white_check_mark:` (‚úÖ) = I have completed my action on the request

_When acknowledging a statement:_

- `:thumbsup:` üëç = I agree with the statement or I have taken note of it
- `:thumbsdown:` üëé = I disagree with a statement‚Äîencouraged to always follow up with a written response

_When acknowledging a question:_

You should provide a written response unless it's a simple yes/no question, in which case `:thumbs-up:` (üëç)/`:thumbs-down:` (üëé) is acceptable.

## Security Ambassador Program

In an effort to work closely with our teammates and shift security focus more into the development process, we are pleased to introduce the Security Ambassador program which will align each one of our security engineers with an engineering organization.

- **What does this mean?**

  - The ambassador assigned to your organization will become very knowledgable on your team's work.
  - The ambassador will help you integrate security thought-processes into your workflow.
  - The ambassador will become your primary point of contact regarding any security concerns that may arise in your development process.
  - The ambassador will be available to join any planning, testing and implementation meetings where their input might be beneficial.

- **Why?**

  - This will allow you to get quicker responses to your security questions and concerns from someone who has a deeper understanding of your team's work.
  - This will allow us to produce a more secure product by integrating security into the early stages of product development.

- **Does this mean I can't talk to anyone else on the security team?**

  - Absolutely not. You are welcome to reach out to anyone in the security team at anytime. We encourage everyone to use the #security slack channel.

- **Who is the ambassador for my team?**

  - https://github.com/sourcegraph/security-issues
- Increase our security posture by running traditional security tools such as vulnerability scanners, SAST, and DAST tools.
  - [Security tooling](./tooling/index.md)
- Create a culture of security at Sourcegraph that empowers all of our engineers to write secure code.
