# Security Incident Response Policy

## Purpose

This document establishes the plan for managing information security incidents and events, and offers guidance for employees or incident responders who believe they have discovered, or are responding to, a security incident.

## Scope

This policy covers all information security or data privacy events or incidents.

## Incident and Event Definitions

- A security event is an observable occurrence relevant to the confidentiality, availability, integrity, or privacy of company controlled data, systems or networks.
- A security incident is a security event which results in loss or damage to the confidentiality, availability, integrity, or privacy of company controlled data, systems or networks.

## Incident Reporting & Documentation

### Reporting

If a Sourcegraph employee, contractor, user, or customer becomes aware of any
possible information security event or incident, unauthorized access, policy violation,
security weakness, or suspicious activity, they can report the incident by emailing
security-team@sourcegraph.com.

If there is strong reason to believe that the possible security incident is ongoing and
could have significant impact to data or systems belonging to Sourcegraph or its
clients, the incident should be raised by emailing security-emergency@sourcegraph.com.
This method should be used with caution as it will page the Security team immediately.

Reports should include specific details about what has been observed or discovered.

### Severity

When raising a security incident, Sourcegraph's security team will assign the
incident a severity based on the following categories:

#### S3/S4 - Low and Medium Severity

Issues meeting this severity are simply suspicions or odd behaviors. They are not verified and require further investigation. There is no clear indicator that systems have tangible risk and do not require emergency response. This includes lost/stolen laptop with disk encryption, suspicious emails, outages, strange activity on a laptop, etc.

#### S2 - High Severity

High severity issues relate to problems where an adversary or active exploitation hasnâ€™t been proven yet, and may not have happened, but is likely to happen. This may include lost/stolen laptop without encryption, vulnerabilities with direct risk of exploitation, threats with risk or adversarial persistence on our systems (e.g.: backdoors, malware), malicious access of business data (e.g.: passwords, vulnerability data, payments information), or threats that put any individual at risk of physical harm.

#### S1 - Critical Severity

Critical issues relate to actively exploited risks and involve a malicious actor. Identification of active exploitation is required to meet this severity category.

## Incident Response Process

In order to standardize the process of incident response and ensure that all required
steps are followed when responding to an incident, a process document must be made
available to all members of the security team. The document should cover all steps
of the incident response process, including:

- Documentation requirements
- Escalation steps
- Client notification requirements
- Post-incident processes, such as postmortem and forensics

The incident response process must be tested at least annually.

### Special Considerations

#### Internal Issues

Issues where the malicious actor is an internal employee, contractor, vendor, or partner requires sensitive handling. The incident manager shall contact the VP of People or the CEO directly and will not discuss with other employees. These are critical issues where follow-up must occur.

## Roles & Responsibilities

Every employee and user of any Sourcegraph information resources has responsibilities toward the protection of the information assets. The table below establishes the specific responsibilities of the incident responder roles.
