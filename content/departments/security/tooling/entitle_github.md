# GitHub access using Entitle

Some of the use cases for using Entitle for GitHub permissions and team access:
- Managers should review access for all of their GitHub teams quarterly
- Teammates might need temporary access to a specific team (i.e job fair)
- Teammates might have switched teams and need to be added to their new team

## Managers' access review for their teams

Please review your teams in GitHub every quarter to ensure only the proper teammates have access. 

In Entitle: 
- Request a specific permission
-- Integration: GitHub
-- Resource: [Name of your team]
-- Role: **Maintainer**
-- Grand method: Direct
-- Duration: (suggested 1 day)
-- Justification: example, "to audit teamm ember access for team xx"

Once approved, you can go into GitHub, review your teammates, and remove/add as needed.
