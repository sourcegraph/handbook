| CVE ID | Affected Images | CVE Severity | CVSS Base Score | [Sourcegraph Assessment](../../../engineering/dev/policies/vulnerability-management-policy.md#severity-levels) | CVSS Environmental Score | Details  |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|- |
| [CVE-2020-7711](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mqqv-chpx-vq25)| | High| 7.5| Info| 0| This report is a false positive reported by some scanners â€“ the version of the library used by Sourcegraph and its dependencies is not affected by this issue. |
| [CVE-2020-7731](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gq5r-cc4w-g8xf)| | High| 7.5| Low| 3.2| This is a denial of service vulnerability that can affect Sourcegraph instances where SAML2 is configured as an authProvider. The availability impact of exploitation would be limited. |
| [CVE-2021-23214](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-467w-rrqc-395f)| sourcegraph/server| High| 8.1| Info| 0| Some vulnerability scanners fingerprint this image as containing PostgreSQL 12.9, while the image actually contains 12.10. This finding is a false positive. |
| [CVE-2021-32027](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8rj6-p58w-wpr2)| sourcegraph/server| High| 8.8| Info| 0| Some vulnerability scanners fingerprint this image as containing PostgreSQL 12.7, while the image actually contains 12.10. This finding is a false positive. |
| [CVE-2021-33194](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-33194)| | High| 7.5| Info| 0| The CVE affects HTML parsers, specifically the `ParseFragment` function. The affected dependencies don't [use the function](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:google/cadvisor%7Cgrafana/grafana%24+ParseFragment&patternType=lucky) nor [import the library](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:google/cadvisor%7Cgrafana/grafana%24+x/net/html&patternType=lucky). |
| [CVE-2021-38561](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-38561)| | High| 7.5| Info| 0| The CVE affects application parsing language tag using the affected library. [Neither of the Sourcegraph dependencies use `x/text` to parse arbitrary language tags](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:google/cadvisor%7Cgrafana/grafana%24+x/text&patternType=literal). |
| [CVE-2021-43565](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gwc9-m7rh-j2ww)| | High| 7.5| Info| 0| This vulnerability is reported in dependencies included by Sourcegraph. Sourcegraph itself doesn't use the vulnerable functionality, and is therefore not affected by the issue. |
| [CVE-2021-44716](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44716)| | High| 7.5| Low| 3.1| In certain conditions, the monitoring functionality packaged with Sourcegraph (Grafana and cAdvisor) could be rendered temporarily inoperable via specially crafted HTTP/2 requests. Exploiting this vulnerability requires administrator-level access, and does not affect the core Sourcegraph functionality. Sourcegraph does not consider this issue a viable security threat to the product. |
| [CVE-2022-1552](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2022-1552/)| sourcegraph/server| High| 8.8| Info| 0| The vulnerability affects Postgres servers with multiple users where one user can bypass authorization controls and execute commands under a superuser identity. Sourcegraph runs Postgres with only the sg user, making the application not affected by this vulnerability. |
| [CVE-2022-2625](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2625)| sourcegraph/server| High| 8.0| Info| 0| Sourcegraph's default permissions model means it is not vulnerable to this issue. |
| [CVE-2022-21698](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21698)| | High| 7.5| Low| 3.6| The vulnerability affects several third party images shipped with Sourcegraph. However, it doesn't affect Sourcegraph directly directly and the third party services are not exposed via HTTP. Sourcegraph is not vulnerable to this vulnerability. |
| [CVE-2022-27191](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27191)| | High| 7.5| Info| 0| This vulnerability impacts SSH servers using the affected dependency. None of the affected images have ssh servers, much less using the dependency. Sourcegraph is not affected by this issue. |
| [CVE-2022-27664](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-69cg-p879-7622)| | High| 7.5| Low| 1.7| This is a denial of service vulnerability that could affect the availability of Sourcegraph services in specific situations. As Sourcegraph is run as an internal service, our assessment of the severity of this issue is Low. |
| [CVE-2022-32149](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-32149)| | High| 7.5| Low| 1.7| This affects `x/text` and is fixed in our frontend image. The other images this issue is present in, are not affected as there's no way for an actor to send arbitrary language headers. |
| [CVE-2022-41912](https://github.com/crewjam/saml/security/advisories/GHSA-j2jp-wvqg-wc2g)| | Critical| 9.1| Info| 0| Sourcegraph does not use the functionality affected by this vulnerability. |
| [CVE-2022-28948](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-28948)| | High| 7.5| Low| 2.1| Sourcegraph is potentially vulnerable to this in the processing of Batch Changes. The possible impact is limited to the user executing the Batch Change thus not presenting any real risk to other users or the stability of the application. |
| [CVE-2023-24998](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24998)| sourcegraph/blobstore, sourcegraph/server| High| 7.5| Low| 2.1| This is a denial of service vulnerability that could affect the availability of Sourcegraph services in specific situations. As Sourcegraph is run as an internal service, our assessment of the severity of this issue is Low. |
| [CVE-2022-41723](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-41723)| | High| 7.5| Low| 2.1| This is a denial of service vulnerability that could affect the availability of Sourcegraph services in specific situations. This vulnerability can only affect via internal traffic within our application, not external access or unauthenticated user, and limited to the site-admin vector. Our assessment of the severity of this issue is Low. |
| [CVE-2023-27561](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27561)| sourcegraph/cadvisor| High| 7.0| Low| 3.9| This vulnerability does not present additional risk for Sourcegraph deployments. Any admin with access to exploit this vulnerability would already have full control over the system. |
