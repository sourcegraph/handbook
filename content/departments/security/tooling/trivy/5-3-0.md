|-|-|-|-|-|-|- |
| [CVE-2023-39325](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325)| sourcegraph/executor, sourcegraph/bundled-executor, sourcegraph/executor-kubernetes, sourcegraph/dind | High| 7.5| Medium| 4.7| The services that are vulnerable to this issue are typically not exposed on the internet. The likelihood of exploitation is low and this does not have a significant impact on the security of the instance. The issue is not present in Sourcegraph itself. |
