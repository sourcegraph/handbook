# Accepted CVEs for Sourcegraph 5.2.4-rc.1
| CVE ID | Affected Images | CVE Severity | CVSS Base Score | [Sourcegraph Assessment](../../../engineering/dev/policies/vulnerability-management-policy.md#severity-levels) | CVSS Environmental Score | Details  |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|- |
| [CVE-2023-39325](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39325)| | High| 7.5| Medium| 4.7| The services that are vulnerable to this issue are typically not exposed on the internet. The likelihood of exploitation is low and this does not have a significant impact on the security of the instance. The issue is not present in Sourcegraph itself. |
| [GHSA-M425-MQ94-257G](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go)| caddy, sourcegraph/executor-kubernetes, sourcegraph/dind, sourcegraph/executor, sourcegraph/bundled-executor| High| 7.5| Medium| 5| We are not vulnerable to 'gRPC-Go HTTP/2 Rapid Reset vulnerability' because we do not expose these service directly to the internet and only reacheable through direct access to the infrastructure. |
| [CVE-2023-5363](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/24/1)| caddy, sourcegraph/dind, sourcegraph/github-proxy| High| 0| | NVD had no metrics available at this time (or returned non-200 response for CVE).| We are not vuln for 'openssl: Incorrect cipher key and IV length processing' because. |
| [CVE-2023-45142](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-45142)| caddy, sourcegraph/dind| High| 7.5| | Calculate using https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H see handbook Triaging section for more details| Sourcegarph is not vulnerable since the affected package is not exposed directly to the internet. |
| [CVE-2023-47108](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-47108)| sourcegraph/dind| High| 0| | NVD had no metrics available at this time (or returned non-200 response for CVE).| We are not vuln for 'opentelemetry-go-contrib: DoS vulnerability in otelgrpc due to unbound cardinality metrics' because. |
| [CVE-2023-45853](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/20/9)| sourcegraph/github-proxy| Critical| 0| | NVD had no metrics available at this time (or returned non-200 response for CVE).| We are not vuln for 'zlib: integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_6' because. |
