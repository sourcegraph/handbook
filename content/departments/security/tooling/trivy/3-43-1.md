Sourcegraph runs Postgres with only the sg user, making the application not affected by this vulnerability.                                                                                                                             |

None of the affected images have ssh servers, much less using the dependency. Sourcegraph is not affected by this issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Exploiting this vulnerability requires administrator-level access, and does not affect the core Sourcegraph functionality. Sourcegraph does not consider this issue a viable security threat to the product.        |
