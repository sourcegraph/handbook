This vulnerability impacts SSH servers using the affected dependency. Caddy does not have ssh servers, much less using the dependency. Sourcegraph is not affected by this issue.                                                                                                                                                                    |

This is a denial of service vulnerability that could affect the availability of Sourcegraph services in specific situations. As Sourcegraph is run as an internal service, our assessment of the severity of this issue is Low.                                                                                                                      |
