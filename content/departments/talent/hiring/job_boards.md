# Job boards

We welcome suggestions for more places that we can post!

## We cross-post our open positions to the following locations:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=sourcegraph). All jobs that are publically listed in our applicant tracking system are automatically pushed to LinkedIn.
- ["Ask HN: Who is Hiring" monthly thread](hacker-news-who-is-hiring.md). Devon Coords posts one job to Hacker News on the first of every month.
- [RemoteWoman](https://remotewoman.com/). RemoteWoman scrapes our career page, we can also message them to manually post our unlisted roles.
- [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/). With our current plan we can post up to 10 roles at a time (and can rotate out roles as they are filled). Devon Coords owns this list and payments are made with Nick's Brex. We can update our posted roles anytime by emailing jobpostings@hiretechladies.com.
- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Sourcegraph-EI_IE1356770.11,22.htm) All jobs that are publically listed in our applicant tracking system are automatically pushed to Glassdoor.
- [Blind] Coming soon

## Additional job boards and coding bootcamps we have posted to in the past:

- [Melanin.tech](https://melanin.tech/)
- [Support Driven](https://supportdriven.com/)
- [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)
- [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/)
- [POCIT](https://peopleofcolorintech.com/). People of Color in Tech.
- [PDXWIT](https://www.pdxwit.org/). Portland Oregon Women in Tech.

## Job boards we will consider in the future:

We want to make sure our job postings reach a wide audience and that we're posting in multiple places without a large overlap in members from our existing job postings.
