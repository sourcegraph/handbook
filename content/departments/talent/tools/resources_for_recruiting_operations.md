# Resources for Recruiting Operations

The Talent team at Sourcegraph is on a mission to create an incredible candidate experience, hire the best talent, and uphold our [company values](../../../company-info-and-process/values/index.md).

## How to Submit an Interview Scheduling Request

Need an interview scheduled for one of your candidates? Submit a request one of the following ways, depending on your role.

How Recruiters Submit Interview Requests:

- When a candidate has passed the [Recruiter Screen](../process/types_of_interviews.md#recruiter-screen) stage of the Interview Process, the Recruiter will request interview scheduling from a coordinator.
  - Currently requests are submitted in the private ‘talent-scheduling-and-offers’ Slack channel (subject to change).
  - The interview schedule request needs to include the following information: Candidate name, Job Title, [Interview Type](../process/types_of_interviews.md), Candidate Availability, and any relevant notes.
- The coordinator will provide scheduling status updates (typically done via emoji on the recruiter’s Slack message with the schedule request)

How All Other Teammates Submit Interview Requests:

- Simply let the appropriate Recruiter and/or Recruiting Operations Specialist know what you would like scheduled in whatever format is easiest for you (email, slack, tagging them in Greenhouse, etc.). Please include the candidate’s full name and which [types of interviews](../process/types_of_interviews.md#resume-deep-dive) you would like scheduled. We will let you know if we have any follow up questions!
  - If you do not hear back from us in 24-48 hours, please send a kind reminder over Slack!

## Interview Scheduling:

### How to Schedule an Interview

1. Find the candidate’s profile in Greenhouse by searching for their name
2. On the On1Job tab, note the candidate’s current step in the interview process and their availability for the next interview step(s).
   1. The recruiter and/or hiring manager will let you know which step(s) need to be scheduled
   2. The candidate’s availability will be listed in _your_ time zone, meaning, whichever time zone you designated for yourself under your Greenhouse settings
      1. You can find the candidate’s time zone by scrolling up to the top of their profile and looking under their name. Alternative ways to find a candidate’s location are within their resume on the Details tab, or on the Linkedin tab.
3. Click “Schedule Interview” to the right of the interview section that you need to schedule. 3. Pro tip: Open this in a new window so you can view the candidate’s availability side by side with the scheduling page. 4. This will take you to a page showing you the calendars of each potential interviewer. 5. Remove anyone who does not need to attend the interview 2. The interview plan and job post will specify how many people should be in each interview section and whether or not specific people are required (if there are any discrepancies between the job post and interview plan, ask your recruiter to confirm the panel). 3. Navigate to the Interview Plan tab by clicking on the Job Title at the top of the candidate’s Greenhouse profile, then selecting Job Setup, Interview Plan, the Edit icon next to the corresponding interview stage, then scrolling to the Default Interviewers section.
4. Select an available time on the calendar within Greenhouse that corresponds with the candidate’s availability.
5. Click “Schedule and Continue”
6. The Email template, Subject Line, and Description will auto populate. All you need to do is click “Add Video Conferencing, select “Zoom”, and mark one of the interviewers as the Zoom Host. 6. Important note: if one of the interviewers is \_not \_the zoom host, they will not be able to cancel the interview recording in BrightHire should the candidate request that in real time.
7. Before sending any interview invitations, please double check the interviewers’ availability within Google Calendar by clicking “Open in Google Cal”. 7. This will open a separate tab. You can see the interview zoom link in the body of the invite, as well as the interviewers’ names listed as Guests. 8. Use the “Find a Time” tool to confirm all interviewers are available during the interview time 9. Important note: the calendar shown in Greenhouse does not include interviewers’ working hours. You must open in Google Calendar to ensure that you are scheduling an interview within working hours.
8. Click “Save”, “Send”, and “Invite all guests”.

### Scheduling Best Practices

- Scheduling over other meetings on interviewers’ calendars
  - Try to avoid scheduling over other meetings on interviewers' calendars and be considerate of interviewers' working hours. If absolutely necessary, you can slack an interviewer to see if any of their meetings are flexible in order to accommodate a candidate's availability.
    - Hiring Managers are busy. When sending a slack, include helpful context such as the role, candidate name, and type of interview. Be sure to convert any timeframes you reference into their time time zone. If you reference any conflicting meetings on their calendar, send them a bulleted list or screenshot of which meetings you’re referencing.
- When scheduling more than one interview step, try to schedule back to back interviews on the same day
  - Oftentimes scheduling interview steps on the same day is not possible due to the interviewer's varying time zones and schedules. In these cases, it is okay to schedule interviews over multiple days.
- Provide candidates with at least a 15 minute break after two hours of interviews, if possible
- Schedule interviews using the candidate’s earliest availability within reason
- Unless specified, interview sections can be scheduled in any order. For example, the peer interview does not have to be completed prior to the cross-functional collaboration interview.
  - However, there are exceptions to the rule. The recruiter will tell you which sections are needed and if a specific order is required. Typically the [Leadership Interview(s)](../process/types_of_interviews.md#leadership-interview) are saved for last.
- Confirm that all interviews scheduled within the next 24 hours have been accepted by interviewers and confirmed by candidates.
  - You can quickly confirm in Google Calendar by opening the “Interviews” calendar, clicking on each interview, and ensuring that all the panelists have a green checkmark next to their name.
- Utilize tools like [TextExpander](../../../company-info-and-process/remote/teammate-recommended_productivity_hacks.md#other-tools) or [Text Blaze](https://blaze.today/) for things you tend to type or hyperlink often
- Always seek to improve!
  - Look for opportunities to make your workflow more efficient and if someone has an idea, listen.
