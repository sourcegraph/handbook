## Information for Sourcegraph Teammates

### Future Internship Cohorts

While this is our first internship program, it won’t be our last! We welcome questions and feedback in the #hiring slack channel so we can improve for future intern cohorts.

### How to request an intern for your team

Intern positions for the first cohort (May-August 2022) have been finalized. More info coming soon about how to request an intern for future cohorts.

Having an intern is not guaranteed, but the Talent Team will connect with leadership and do their best to align interns with teams as needed.

### My intern request was approved, now what?

If your team is selected to have an intern, the recruiter will reach out via slack to request your job description and interview plan. The hiring manager will be required to develop a job description following the steps in the handbook. Once finalized, the recruiter will get the role set up in Greenhouse, posted to our job boards, and then create a private slack channel for the hiring team to stay aligned throughout the interview process. From there the recruiter will begin sourcing, recruiting, and scheduling interviews.
