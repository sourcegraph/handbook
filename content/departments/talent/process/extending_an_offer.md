## Offer stage

**Step 1:** once finalist is identified, Recruiter completes references if necessary.
- Learn more about our reference check philosophy [here](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/talent/process/reference_check_questions).

**Step 2**: the Recruiter confirms level and compensation.

- [Compensation philosophy](../../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/index.md#components-of-compensation).

**Step 3**: the Recruiter has a pre-closing conversation with the candidate to confirm mutual-interest. It is very important that the Recruiter makes no offer promises or commitments to the candidate until the offer has been formally approved in Greenhouse.

**Step 4**: the Recruiter [creates an offer in Greenhouse](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200721744-Create-offer)

- The offer start date **must** align on a cohort start date, which take place every 2-weeks.
  - If you need to start a Teammate on a non-cohort date, you must receive approval from Head of Talent and HR. To receive approval, please send a Slack to Head of Talent, Noemi and Ines with business case for starting on a non-cohort date.
- Recruiter inputs number of equity options into the Stock Option Calculator, and transfers information into offer in Greenhouse.
- Approval chain: Talent Team Manager (if applicable) > VP Talent > Hiring Manager > Department Head > VP Operations.
- We want to hire people who overwhelmingly get `Yes` and `Strong Yes` feedback. If the candidate did not receive all `"Yes"` or `"Strong Yes"` in feedback, the Hiring Manager or Recruiter needs to submit written justification for moving forward with offer in the offer approval section.

**Step 5**: once the offer is **fully approved** in Greenhouse, Recruiter schedules an offer summary call. The purpose of the offer summary call is to review our offer with the candidate and answer any questions they may have.

- Attendees: Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate.
- To generate the offer summary, click "generate" in the Offer Details section of the candidate's Greenhouse profile.
- Offer Summary call agenda:
  - The Hiring Manager kicks off the call to give the candidate feedback and tell why we’re excited about them.
  - The Recruiter then shares their screen to display the offer summary document.
  - The Recruiter then covers our compensation philosophy, the compensation specifics, perks, travel (and benefits, if applicable), and equity.
  - The Hiring Manager and Recruiter answer any questions and ask how the candidate is feeling about the opportunity.
  - Before ending the call, be sure to 1) determine a potential start date (all start dates should fall on a cohort Monday and any exceptions to that rule require approval from VP of Talent and People Ops) and 2) schedule a follow-up call to answer any questions.

**Step 6**: following the offer call, the Recruiter sends the offer summary to the candidate in an email, and Cc's the Hiring Manager and VP Talent.

**Step 7**: once the candidate verbally accepts the offer, the Recruiter follows the below steps:

- If US-based candidate: make a formal request in the Slack channel `talent-scheduling-and-offers` for an offer letter to be sent via DocuSign.
- If a Contractor candidate: make a formal request in the Slack channel `talent-scheduling-and-offers` for an offer letter to be sent via DocuSign.
- If onboarding via a PEO, make a formal request in the Slack channel 'peo-visa-hiring` to begin the PEO onboarding process
  - COMING SOON: learn more about hiring via PEOs here

**Step 8**: the candidate receives the offer.

- For US-based offers, the Recruiting Operations Specialist will send the `US-offer template` via DocuSign.
- For non-US based offers (Contractors), the Recruiting Operations Specialist will confirm the correct template and will send via DocuSign.
  - All DocuSigns should be routed for signing to VP Talent > Candidate and Cc Recruiting@sourcegraph.com, Onboarding@sourcegraph.com and the Hiring Manager
- For PEO candidates, the candidate will receive all offer documentation via the PEO.
