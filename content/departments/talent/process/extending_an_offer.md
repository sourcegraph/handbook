## Offer stage

**Step 1:** once finalist is identified, Recruiter completes references if necessary.

- Learn more about our reference check philosophy [here](../process/reference_check_questions.md)

**Step 2**: the Recruiter confirms level and compensation.

- [Compensation philosophy](../../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/index.md#components-of-compensation).

**Step 3**: the Recruiter has a pre-closing conversation with the candidate to confirm mutual-interest. It is very important that the Recruiter makes no offer promises or commitments to the candidate until the offer has been formally approved in Greenhouse.

**Step 4**: the Recruiter [creates an offer in Greenhouse](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200721744-Create-offer)

- The offer start date **must** align with a [cohort start date](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y182OTdwMnZyMnA3cmJnYzNrMTRiODAwc2gxZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), which take place every 2-weeks.
  - If you need to start a Teammate on a non-cohort date, you must receive approval from Head of Talent and HR. To receive approval, please send a Slack to Head of Talent, Noemi and Ines with business case for starting on a non-cohort date.
- Recruiter inputs number of equity options into the Stock Option Calculator, and transfers information into offer in Greenhouse.
- Approval chain: Talent Team Manager (if applicable) > VP Talent > Hiring Manager > Department Head > VP Operations.
- We want to hire people who overwhelmingly get `Yes` and `Strong Yes` feedback. If the candidate did not receive all `"Yes"` or `"Strong Yes"` in feedback, the Hiring Manager or Recruiter needs to submit written justification for moving forward with offer in the offer approval section.

**Step 5**: once the offer is **fully approved** in Greenhouse, Recruiter schedules an offer summary call using the email template in Greenhouse. The purpose of the offer summary call is to review our offer with the candidate and answer any questions they may have.

- Attendees: Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate.
- To generate the offer summary, click "generate" in the Offer Details section of the candidate's Greenhouse profile.
- Offer Summary call agenda:
  - The Hiring Manager kicks off the call to give the candidate feedback and tell why weâ€™re excited about them.
  - The Recruiter then shares their screen to display the offer summary document.
  - The Recruiter then covers our compensation philosophy, the compensation specifics, perks, travel (and benefits, if applicable), and equity.
  - The Hiring Manager and Recruiter answer any questions and ask how the candidate is feeling about the opportunity.
  - Before ending the call, be sure to 1) determine a potential start date (all start dates should fall on a cohort Monday and any exceptions to that rule require approval from VP of Talent and People Ops) and 2) schedule a follow-up call to answer any questions.

**Step 6**: following the offer call, the Recruiter sends the offer summary to the candidate in an email, and Cc's the Hiring Manager and VP Talent.

**Step 7**: once the candidate verbally accepts the offer, the Recruiter follows the below steps:

- If US-based candidate: make a formal request in the Slack channel `talent-scheduling-and-offers` for an offer letter to be sent via DocuSign.
- If a Contractor candidate: make a formal request in the Slack channel `talent-scheduling-and-offers` for an offer letter to be sent via DocuSign.
- If onboarding via a PEO, make a formal request in the Slack channel 'peo-visa-hiring` to begin the PEO onboarding process
  - COMING SOON: learn more about hiring via PEOs here

**Step 8**: the candidate receives the offer.

- For US-based offers, the Recruiting Operations Specialist will send the `US-offer template` via DocuSign.
- For non-US based offers (Contractors), the Recruiting Operations Specialist will confirm the correct template and will send via DocuSign.
  - All DocuSigns should be routed for signing to VP Talent > Candidate and Cc Recruiting@sourcegraph.com, Onboarding@sourcegraph.com and the Hiring Manager
- For PEO candidates, the candidate will receive all offer documentation via the PEO.
