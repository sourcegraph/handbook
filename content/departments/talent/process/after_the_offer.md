## Onboarding process for US-based teammates & contractors

After the candidate formally signs the offer letter via DocuSign (or PEO documentation if onboarding via PEO), the Recruiter takes the following steps to onboard the new Teammate:

**Step 1**: via Greenhouse, the Recruiter sends a welcome email to the candidate by selecting the `"welcome email from recruiter - US"` or the `"welcome email from recruiter - Non-US"`template, depending on the location of the new Teammate.

- To: the Candidate
- CC: Recruiting@sourcegraph.com, Onboarding@sourcegraph.com, Hiring Manager
- This should be sent within 24-hours of acceptance.

**Step 2**: the Recruiter confirms that the open, start and hired dates are correct, ensuring accurate time-to-fill data.

- Click the "Mark Candidate as Hired" button found in the "Offer Details" section of the candidate's profile
- Select Close Reason - "hire-new headcount" or "hire-backfill"
- Click either `"yes"` or `"no"` in the "Keep Job Open" section. Only keep the job open if we are hiring for multiple openings
- Select `"Yes"` for "Make Candidate Private"
- Select `"Yes"` for "Export to BambooHR
- Email a summary of this candidate to:
  - Onboarding Email
  - VP of Talent
  - Hiring Manager

**Step 6**: the Recruiter sends a "thank you for participating in the interview process" note to the interview team in the role-specific Slack channel 

**Step 7**: the Recruiter archives the Channel after people respond

**Step 8**: the Recruiter asks the Hiring Manager to make a announcement of the candidate's acceptance in the Slack #Hiring channel.

**Step 8**: the People Operations team then works with the candidate to onboard them and get them set up for their first day!

## Changing a new hire's start date 
If a new hire needs to change their start date, the Recruiter follows the below steps:

**Step 1**: Send the below Slack to Ines, Noemi, & Carly to request approval to change the start date. 
_Please note: all requests must be at least 5-days before the new start date to allow enough time for People Ops to onboard

"Hi team, we have a candidate who would like to move their start date. Please find their updated details below. Do we have the green light to make the change? If so, I will update the hire date in Greenhouse and will send an email with the updated start date. 
- Name: ____
- Original start date: ______
- New start date: (must be a cohort date): ______"

**Step 2**: Update new start date in Greenhouse (in the offer section).

**Step 3**: Send email to candidate (reply all to the `"welcome email from recruiter"`) confirming their new start date.
