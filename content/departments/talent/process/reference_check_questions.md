# Reference checks

References will be requested on a case-by-case basis and the hiring manager is responsible for deciding which specific references we would like to speak to based on the candidate's work experience and interview performance.

Ultimately, the goal behind our reference checks is to ensure that we are setting up the new hire for success and know how to best work with them.

Based on the candidate’s work experience, the talent team will request specific references from the candidate. Requested references will typically be a former manager(s) and/or colleague(s) and may be from the candidate’s most recent or previous companies. We will never conduct a reference call without explicit consent from the candidate.

The recruiter will ask the hiring manager whether they would like the talent team to conduct references, or if the hiring manager would prefer to conduct them directly. The recruiter will them coordinate calls with references.

**Reference call questions:**

- In what capacity did you two work together?
- What was your role/their role at the time?
- What stood out as [candidate]'s greatest strengths?
- If you were writing their annual review today, where would they have an opportunity to improve or build on their skills?
- What would make [candidate] happy and motivated in a new role?
- Was there ever a time where [candidate] was disrespectful in any way to other members of the team?
- Do you have any advice for their future manager?
- If given the opportunity, would you hire [candidate] again?
