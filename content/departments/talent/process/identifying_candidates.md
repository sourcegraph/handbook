## Using external recruiting agencies

We only partner with agencies in select instances as approved by the VP Talent and Finance. To request agency usage, please Slack #hiring with your request, along with a business case for using an agency.

- Q: Am I allowed to engage with an external agency if I have an assigned internal recruiter?
  - A: This should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to see what is the required candidate pipeline to meet the teamâ€™s hiring goals. If internal recruiter(s) are not enough to meet the needs of the team then the hiring manager can seek external help.
- Q: How do I engage with a new agency?
  - A: To engage with a new agency, please Slack @hiring with your request, including 1) the agency name/contact information and 2) the roles that you would like the agency to work on. As a next step, the VP of Talent will send and sign all agency agreements. All agencies sign our [standard agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IU_eWoZxEGQS8RRcjuUPfVD-byWScn5bsZE3e3oFZQ0/edit). The folder to store agency contracts can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1aEtbTvcQF7hfd3mHH0JMgBhlFLYL4piq)
- Q: What fee do we pay?
  - Our standard agency fee is 20%.
- Q: How do agencies submit candidates for consideration?
  - A: The talent team will set each agency up with a Greenhouse account. All agencies **must** submit candidates via Greenhouse. Please contact #hiring or recruiting@sourcegraph.com to get an agency added to Greenhouse.
- Q: What do I do if an agency recruiter (with whom we do **not** have an agreement) emails me a candidate?
  - A: Please forward any emails from agencies to recruiting@sourcegraph.com.
