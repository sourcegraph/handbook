# Sourcegraph Research Panel

Here at Sourcegraph we exude [dev love](../../../../company-info-and-process/values/index.md#dev-love) and recognize that it is the feedback from all of you which makes our product even better.

In order to continue improving, we would like to introduce you and your fellow developers to our new research program, **Sourcegraph Research**, open to developers of all levels, managers, and leaders, frequent AND infrequent users.

## How does it work?

By joining Sourcegraph Research, you agree to receive periodic invites to research studies that best match the information you provide in our short 2 - 3 minute [sign up form](https://share.hsforms.com/1tkScUc65Tm-Yu98zUZcLGw1n7ku).

Our team will only use this information to schedule research activity. Your responses will not be shared with anyone and you can opt out at any time.

## Why join Sourcegraph Research?

If you join, you can get:

- Access to early betas and new features
- A chance to directly impact Sourcegraph product and roadmaps
- Invitations to research studies, both [compensated](./compensating-research-participants.md) and uncompensated
- Direct access to product designers and product managers

## What kinds of studies could you be invited to?

### User interviews

Chat with a member of the product team about your experiences. This type of research study usually involves open-ended questions about your experiences.

### Usability tests

For this kind of research study, you could be asked to test out a new feature or concept and provide feedback. During usability tests, you’ll talk out loud while testing so that the product team can better understand your thoughts, feelings, and actions. Note that usability tests could include anything from a fully functioning prototype to static wireframes.

### Surveys

We regularly send out surveys to better understand the people using Sourcegraph. This information helps us better understand developer attitudes as well as influence future roadmaps.
