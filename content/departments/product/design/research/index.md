# UX Research

The goal of UX research at Sourcegraph is to connect with Sourcegraph users and gather insight into their behaviors, motivations, and goals. We use these insights to inform and strengthen product and design decisions.
UX Researchers are one of the many Sourcegraph team members who conduct user research. Other roles, such as Product Managers and Product Designers, frequently conduct research.

## Conducting UX Research at Sourcegraph

Here at Sourcegraph, we bucket research into two types:
| Research type | Definition | Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) | Research methodologies |
| --- | --------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Generative | Explore the problem space including foundational (e.g. we know very little about this problem space) and descriptive (we know the problem but none of the specifics) research | UX Researchers (UXR) | <ul><li>User interviews</li><li>Diary studies</li><li>Participatory design</li><li>Contextual inquiry</li><li>Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)</li><li>Journey maps</li><li>Competitive analysis</li></ul> |
| Evaluative | Assess the success of a solution that has already been addressed in some way | Product Designers (PD) | <ul><li>Hallway testing</li><li>Usability testing</li><li>A/B testing</li><li>Tree testing</li><li>Card sorting</li></ul> |

## Research tools

- [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) is used for scheduling research sessions with users.
- [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) is used for surveys, screening surveys, and contacting members of Sourcegraphâ€™s Research Panel.
- [UserTesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/) is used for certain unmoderated testing for evaluative testing and some moderated interviews for generative research. Note: UserTesting.com offers analysis tools but we prefer exporting the videos to Dovetail for analysis to keep a single source of truth.
- [Dovetail](https://dovetail.com/) is used to analyze data, collaborate on insights, and as a research repository.

If you need access to any of these tools, please contact @Megan St. Andrew.
