# Design Template: Medium

- Estimate: Two weeks to a month
- Notes:

  - When creating the issue, use the label `design-estimated-M`
  - Ideally, design should be given sufficient time in the problem space to explore and research.
  - Design should be happening at least one iteration before engineering is planned. If user testing is required before or after design, this should be factored into the design time.
  - These efforts require close collaboration with the Product Manager to scope and define the user problems being solved.

  - Estimate: Two weeks to one month
  - Weighting factors:
    - Note: A small issue should not be high impact and high certainty.
    - HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW risk
