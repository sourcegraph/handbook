# Design Template: Large

- Estimate: Two weeks to a month
- Notes:

  - When creating the issue, use the label `design-estimated-L`
  - Ideally, design should be given sufficient time in the problem space to explore and research.
  - Design should be happening at least one iteration before engineering is planned. If user testing is required before or after design, this should be factored into the design time.
  - These efforts require close collaboration with the Product Manager to scope and define the user problems being solved.
