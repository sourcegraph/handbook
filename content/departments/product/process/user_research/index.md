### User journey

- [Holistic and evolving Sourcegraph user journey](https://www.figma.com/file/WbT5q4siamRuBjLhhlTAyG/sourcegraph.com-user-journey?node-id=0%3A1) - This user journey map is an evolving study of the choices and decisions users make from initial contact through to on-going usage of the product.

### Installation

- **Self-hosted installation user experience study** - This study evaluated the ability of users to find the installation method and successfully install and configure the product. It also contains analytics of the installation path from account creation to initial searches.
