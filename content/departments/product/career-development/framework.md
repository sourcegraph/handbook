# Sourcegraph product career development framework

Our career development framework is here to help you understand the expectations of your role, and to provide a common language for you and your manager to discuss and plan your career growth. It is also an important part of our larger goal of ensuring everyone is equitably recognized for the impact they have at work, and to reduce bias in promotions and hiring.

## What are the expectations of my role?

We have shared expectations for all product managers, regardless of level or role. On top of that we have additional levels showing how a teammate’s impact, scope, execution, and teamwork varies by level.

- Impact: The tangible and positive difference made through one's contributions to the company’s mission.
- Scope: The breadth and depth of one’s technical and non-technical expertise, including how one maps business goals to technical solutions.
- Execution: The ability to consistently and efficiently translate plans into outcomes.
- Teamwork: The art of collaborating effectively with others, both within and outside the organization.

Expectations for a level add to the expectations of earlier levels. In addition, we expect product managers at all levels to exhibit our values.
