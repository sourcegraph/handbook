### My view on People

I believe every person is their own interesting, complex and fascinating universe. Getting to know them and trying to help is one of the most exciting things for me. I love trying to make people's life better, even if it is by making people smile.
I think the People team is here to listen to teammates, understand their needs and make their working environment a place they actually enjoy and don't just work because they have to.

### Preferred learning styles

I need to find engaging and varied resources. I am a very fast learner which means I lose interest quickly if the resources are too long or monotonous.

### Communication style

I like context, because I get annoyed when I have to hunt for information to later discover someone already knew the answer. I enjoy synchronous meetings because it means bonding with people, but when it comes to time management, asynchronous communication is my preferred method. But above all I like honesty and directness.

### Preferred way to collaborate

Openly and when everyone is willing to listen to other people’s input. Any method that helps me trigger creativity and allows me to think of new things is perfect.

### How I approach problems

I like understanding what is happening from different points of view and I try very hard to put myself in other people’s shoes. I sometimes need help processing and just talking to someone about the problem is what I need to find the right way to approach the problem.

### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

I don’t feel comfortable telling people about my achievements but discovered I feel warmth whenever someone surprises me with a note or message of appreciation, be it privately or publicly.

### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

I feel very comfortable saying I don’t know how to do something (and asking for help), but I don’t find it easy saying I can’t do something because I don’t have enough time, even if it’s not because I mismanaged my time.

### What I find enjoyable at work

The people. It’s all about connecting and making other people feel better about themselves, making their lives and jobs easier, and building relationships. I also love learning something different everyday, even if it is something quirky that makes no difference to my day to day life. Just like people, it simply makes the world a more interesting place.

### What kind of work do I find easiest to do when

I find socializing in the morning hard, that’s why doing solo work in the mornings is perfect. That’s when I read, document or do the thinking as I also find it easier to concentrate in the mornings. Miscellaneous, meetings, and jumping from one thing to another I do best in the afternoon.

### How do I feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for me to see and respond to during active hours

I generally don’t mind. If I have the time and the information handy I’ll reply, if I can’t I’ll do it during my working hours.

### How folks can best show up for me when I seem off

My off days are not common. If I have one, it’s probably me processing and talking about it might make me annoyed, even when the other person comes with their best intentions. Just asking if I’m okay and saying you are there is enough. If I feel I’m being pushed into talking about it I might shut off even more, I’ll share when I’m ready.

### Things I am aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

I get anxious when I feel I’m not reaching a timeline. But it’s even worse when I think my actions affect someone else personally or their work.

### Areas of knowledge

Work-wise: Presenting complex information, learning and training principles, communicating to large audiences, asynchronous work best practices, org-specific onboarding, creating scripts for demo videos.

Life-wise: Disney movies, fiction books, making great lemon pies and apparently Greek mythology.

### Areas of interest to learn

Anything I don’t know. Tech of course, but also how to think differently is very appealing to me.

### Current personal project

My new year’s resolution was to read a book a month. I'm still optimistic.

### Something I fear

Heights and not living life to the fullest (and birds but it’s a very unpopular opinion).

### A quote I like

“Sometimes you have to inject yourself with some fantasy to not to die from reality.” I don’t think it’s a real quote though, but I like it.

### How I eat fries

Happily. And with mayo or cheese. Or fried eggs. Or plain… fries are the best!

### My sun, moon, and rising signs

Sun sign: Gemini
Moon sign: Capricorn
Rising sign: Taurus Ascendant

But I have no idea what this means, I literally just googled it.

### My enneagram

Enthusiastic Visionary
