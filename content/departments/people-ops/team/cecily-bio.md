# Cecily README

### My view on people

I believe that the relationships you have with the people in your life are essential to true happiness. I strongly prioritize my own interpersonal relationships, and it is amazing to be part of a department, team, and company that believes and lives this sentiment.

### Preferred learning styles

I am definitely a hands-on learner. I learn best by doing a process myself or by watching someone do a process and trying it after.

I also learn well through writing as long as the written format is digestible/organized, such as in listed in bullet points or as an agenda (versus long paragraphs).

### Communication style

My preferred communication style is written, as it gives me time to review my responses and ensure I get all points across, details communicated, and questions asked.

I am great with verbal communication and do not mind meetings or quick syncs as necessary! I just default to written communication in a work setting because it gives me time to think.

### Preferred way to collaborate

I prefer 1 on 1 meetings or asynchronous collaboration. I am always open to quick meetings as necessary, of course.

### How I approach problems

If a problem requires a simple solution, such as action on my part, I tackle it head-on. Otherwise, I like to weigh the perspectives of everyone involved in a situation before making decisions or taking action towards a solution.

### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

I prefer to be recognized directly, but definitely do not mind being recognized publicly for my contributions. Being told that my work is appreciated goes an incredibly long way in making me feel accomplished and useful in the workplace.

### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

I almost always lean towards trying to figure things out for myself before asking for help. However, I highly value the knowledge that my co-workers have to provide and am therefore learning to ask for help more often. When I do ask for help, I like to understand the “why” behind the way things are done.

### What I find enjoyable at work

The random socializing that comes from sharing a space (this is hard without a physical office!), building relationships with my coworkers, and being helpful to my coworkers and the organization as a whole.

### What kind of work do I find easiest to do when

I focus best and prefer to do solo work in the morning, and tend to prefer having meetings in the late morning/early afternoon.

### How do I feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for me to see and respond to during active hours

Just fine! I have notifications turned off when I am not actively working to ensure I keep my work and personal life separate.

### How folks can best show up for me when I seem off

I am not good at expressing when things aren’t going well personally, so if you notice something is off, definitely feel free to ask! I usually just power through when things aren’t going well, so being approached directly helps me feel more comfortable asking for what I need.

### Things I am aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

Making mistakes that affect my coworkers. I want to help my coworkers as much as I can and highly value - and encourage - feedback in all forms.

### Areas of knowledge

Work-wise: making information digestible, organized documentation, coordination, communication

Life-wise: space, psychology, camping

### Areas of interest to learn

Data analytics, coding, music, off-grid living

### Current personal project

My overall health and wellness.

### Something I fear

Being alone, as in, no interpersonal relationships.

### A quote I like

“You either suffer through the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.”

### How I eat fries

With ranch dressing! Or plain salt. Or virtually any way (except ketchup). Potatoes and I have had a long, beautiful relationship that no other food has come close to rivaling.

### My sun, moon, and rising signs

Libra sun, Virgo moon, and Scorpio rising
