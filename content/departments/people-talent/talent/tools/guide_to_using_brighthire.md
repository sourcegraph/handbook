# Guide to Using BrightHire

## What is BrightHire?

Simply put, [BrightHire](https://brighthire.ai/) is our interview recording tool. It is a interview intelligence platform built on Zoom to help run structured, high-quality interviews that can be replayed, shared and analyzed.

BrightHire rides along in Zoom interviews with an interactive notepad. All you need is the Chrome extension and Zoom and you’re all set. It records and transcribes the interview, making it easy to give thorough feedback in Greenhouse. The platform supports our equal opportunity hiring efforts by ensuring we evaluate each candidate on their own words with consistent interview criteria.

Here is a 1 minute [BrightHire tour](https://www.loom.com/share/8b7de9e5e7f1454c933960e00ca22db5?sid=06b89f07-5b52-40a8-b82d-cf4523b615da) to help you familiarize yourself with key features of the platform.

## Why do we record our interviews?

We believe that candidates should be assessed based on merit, not our memory (did you know that one hour after an interview, memory recall of the conversation declines to 44%?). BrightHire allows us to revisit key details, revise initial impressions, and replace implicit bias with explicit evidence. It brings structure and consistency to each interview and ensures that every candidate gets the opportunity they deserve.

BrightHire also helps our interviewers feel confident that they are providing an excellent candidate experience by running a fair and effective interview process. After every interview, full highlights from the conversation provide evidence that is essential for strong decision making and reducing bias. Along with training, this will help us check and mitigate the unconscious biases that we bring into interviews and hiring decisions.

Specifically, BrightHire helps with:

- **Equitable Hiring:** BrightHire helps us reduce bias in every interview and hiring decision by facilitating structured, consistent and evidence-based hiring for a fundamentally more equitable process.
- **Quality & Consistency**: BrightHire takes the gut-feelings and guesswork out of our decision making process, helping Sourcegraph uncover the best talent and raise the quality of every single interview, assessment and hiring decision our team makes.
- **Speed & Efficiency**: BrightHire helps us make great hires in record time by shortening feedback loops, removing unnecessary steps, and eliminating misalignment across our hiring teams.

Click on each question within the BrightHire window so that they're timespamped in the recording. The entire interview will be captured and transcribed for you, but if you choose to take notes, please do so under each question in BrightHire.

If you forget to click "Complete scorecard" within BrightHire, simply navigate to your Greenhouse scorecard by clicking the link in your interview calendar invite.
#### Step 5 (import your BrightHire notes to Greenhouse): 
On your Greenhouse scorecard, click the blue "View recording" button on the side panel. You will be shown the manual notes that you took in BrightHire. Next to "Interview Questions" above the first question in Greenhouse, click the blue "Import notes" button with a BrightHire symbol. Any notes you took within BrightHire will then be automatically pulled to each question within Greenhouse, along with a hyperlinked timespamp of when it was asked in the interview so that you can easily reference that answer back.
#### Step 6 (leveraging AI for your notes):
If you'd like to leverage notes that the AI notetaker has created for you, click on the "AI Notes" tab on your BrightHire side panel. You can copy the entire interview, or notes from each question, by clicking on the double square symbol and pasting them into your Greenhouse scorecard wherever they may the most sense.

#### Step 7 (complete and submit your Greenhouse scorecard): 
Fill in the focus attributes and overall recommendation within your Greenhouse scorecard and submit the scorecard when it's complete (ideally no later than 24 hours after the interview). There is an option to view the BrightHire recording on the side panel if you need to reference your interview back.

## How to leverage BrightHire recordings to make informed hiring decisions

When our hiring teams review and share interviews, they can work together to triangulate perspectives, check bias, and avoid costly mistakes. Reviewing candidate answers with full context instead of relying on human memory can lead to a better quality of hire.

Below are features to leverage within BrightHire to help facilitate structured, consistent and evidence-based hiring:

### Candidate profiles: 
Under the candidates tab in Bright Hire, you can search for candidates by name and access their profiles. These profiles include highlights and summaries that have been captured during the interview process. You can share these profiles with your team by copying the URL and pasting it into Slack. This feature is beneficial to use prior to interview debriefs.
### Comparing candidates side by side: 
Within the candidate compare page, you can place two candidates side by side and compare how they answer the same questions. Highlights from each interview are easily accessible and can be viewed alongside each other. Loom instructions for candidate profiles and compare pages can be found [here](https://www.loom.com/share/1c2dc7f0b9244555a531b58f9eb06bad?sid=9ed821c9-7b8c-44e1-9a0b-61f4f3b1669d).

Q: How does BrightHire benefit me as a candidate?

- A: BrightHire will help ensure that we are focused on you, not on taking notes. It also ensures that interviews are structured and well thought out, giving you the best opportunity to showcase your relevant experience and qualifications. If you speak with multiple interviewers, BrightHire will help the hiring team coordinate and it’ll be less likely that the same questions are asked in multiple interviews. BrightHire will help interviewers recall important details about your experience and qualifications so they aren’t simply relying on their notes and recollections.

Q: How will I know that my interview is recorded?

- A: You will always know that the interview is being recorded. Sourcegraph will first inform you in the interview confirmation email. Then, if the interview is over the phone, you may hear an audio message announcing the call is being recorded or the interviewer will say the interview is being recorded. If the interview is being conducted over a video conference system, you will see a visual recording notification (like a flashing red recording button), hear an audio message, and/or see a recording notification appear when you join the video-conference.

Q: Can I choose to interview with Sourcegraph without being recorded?

- A: Yes, you can say at any time that you prefer to interview without being recorded. We do not penalize candidates for their choice not to use BrightHire. In rolling out BrightHire, we want to balance the importance of equitable hiring with a candidate's choice and privacy. We respect every candidate’s decision regarding whether or not they want to be recorded, and that’s why we do not require candidates to be recorded or penalize candidates who choose not to. In other words, choosing not to be recorded will have no impact on your candidacy for the role.

Q: Who will be able to see my interview?

There is no legal requirement specifying the amount of time we have to delete the recording. As a matter of policy, Sourcegraph will auto delete all interview recordings within 365 days of the recording. If at any time you would like Sourcegraph to delete your interview recording, you can email your request to support@brighthire.ai and your recording will be deleted (applies to EU residents and to non-EU candidates interviewing with companies that adhere to GDPR).

Q: Is my interview secure?

- A: BrightHire’s first value as a company is to put candidates first, and this shapes every decision they make, including their approach to data security and privacy. They take the responsibility of securing your information very seriously and use a variety of industry-standard technologies and services to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and loss.

Q: Will BrightHire make a judgement about my qualifications for the role?

- A: No. BrightHire is built to help people make better, less biased hiring decisions. The platform may analyze your interview to help your interviewer recall important moments, but BrightHire does not attempt to automatically determine if you’re the right candidate by evaluating your words, voice, or video - that's the interviewer’s job.
