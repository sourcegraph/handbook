# Guide to using TalentWall

## What is TalentWall?

[TalentWall](https://app.talentwall.io/) is our candidate pipeline management and analytics tool. It converts our ATS candidate pipeline into a real-time interactive dashboard that elevates transparency between the Talent Team and hiring leaders.

## Why are we using it?

Through the visualization of our recruiting pipelines, we're able to provide all of our hiring leaders in the organization with a line of sight into each role. This helps us ensure no candidate is falling through the cracks and allows us to efficiently allocate our hiring efforts.

By utilizing the dashboard and reporting functionality, our Hiring Leaders will be able to make informed decisions and accurately prioritize the most important roles in the organization.

## Who has access to TalentWall?

All hiring leaders and Talent Team members will have access to TalentWall as they manage the candidate experience and hiring process.

Recruiting Admins will manage permissions and creation of hiring leader & department specific dashboards.
