# How to prepare for your interview

We know that interviewing can be stressful, so we want to provide you as much information as possible to help you feel prepared. If we are missing anything that would be helpful, please email recruiting@sourcegraph.com.

## Zoom

Pro Tip: To have a smoother experience, be in the Zoom meeting for your interview, ready to go, five minutes before your scheduled interview time. This will help minimize technical glitches.

Useful Tips
Please join the interview from your personal computer or fully charged laptop with video capabilities. Actions on the interview may be recorded.
Please ensure you have a space conducive to a video call for the duration of your interview. This should include high bandwidth internet, headphones, and a microphone.
You may find a mouse more effective than a trackpad.
Ensure that you are in a quiet place where you will not be distracted or disturbed.
If there are technical difficulties during your interview, please reach out to recruiting@sourcegraph.com and the recruiting coordination team will assist or reschedule where needed. â€‹Please find more info on how to troubleshoot zoom _insert link here_ if required.

## Interview recording

Please note, your interviews will be conducted over video and may be recorded so that we can focus on you, not taking notes, and ensure that we're delivering a great interview experience. If you prefer to keep your camera off, and/or not to be recorded during your interview, please let us know - the structure of the interview and decision-making process will remain the same and your preference will have no weight on your candidacy.
