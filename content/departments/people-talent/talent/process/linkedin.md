## Sourcing and Outreach Best Practices

Our goal is to drive meaningful outreach and engagement with prospective candidates. When designing an engagement strategy, the goal is to create a sequence of messages and or/content at touch points delivered to a targeted candidate at predefined intervals.

### Running a high-quality search
Now that you have a project up and running it's time to start sourcing and adding prospects to your project by running searches. 

Familiarize yourself with our [sourcing best practices](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/people-talent/talent/process/identifying_candidates/#sourcing-best-practices). Whether you are sourcing through LinkedIn Recruiter, Twitter, Alumni groups, or other avenues, it’s important to understand our general sourcing best practices.

When we are running searches in LinkedIn Recruiter we prioritize:
- Building strategic and targeted pipelines
    - Take the time to understand what experience you are looking for and why
    - Take time reviewing a candidate’s profile to be able to send thoughtfully crafted inmails.
    - Build pipelines with a specific role, reason, or goal in mind
    - Use pipelines to build long-term candidate relationships
- Finding high potential candidates through representative talent searches
    - Your search criteria does not have unrealistic requirements
    - You are creatively updating your search queries with unique identifiers to find talent that may be hidden from LinkedIn’s “Most Relevant” top search results page
    - You are building talent pools representative of the global workforce

- **Step 1**: Hiring Managers will work with their [designated recruiter and sourcer](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/people-talent/talent/process/teamalignment/) to create realistic search criterias. This will be used to generate an automated pipeline of outbound candidates.
- **Step 2**: [Start running your search criteria on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a413329). 
- **Step 3**: [Filter your search results](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a414281)
  - Filtering your search results will help further identify targeted profiles. Creatively plug and play these filters to thoroughly search through the candidate pool.

    - Location: Any preference on location or time zone for the role.
    - Companies: Any companies that are known to have quality candidates for the role.
    - Years of experience: Possible minimum years of experience required for the role, or is commonly needed to gain the required qualifications.
  - **Unique filter identifiers**:
    - Keywords: Organizations and groups that candidates are currently or were previously involved with (alumni groups, non-profits, open-source communities, etc)
    - Location: Locations that are often overlooked in favor of typical tech hubs
    - Network Relationships: Maximize the network you’ve already built
    - Recruiting activity: Revisit qualified candidates from 3+ months ago

### Outreach Best Practices

[Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c2ZI6IfvkK7syuo8aIBSnWpCF8SqAD12TiPSkTKqhp4/edit) a guide on creating a Recruiting Outreach Campaign.

## Engagement strategy

The engagement strategy is an agreement between the hiring manager and recruiter regarding how they will collaborate and interact with each other and candidates through LinkedIn Recruiter to effectively reach out to prospective profiles. When designing an engagement strategy, the goal is to create a sequence of messages and or/content at touch points delivered to a targeted candidate at predefined intervals.

The Hiring Manager and Recruiter will generally work together on setting up the search criteria based on the required qualifications and spend some time reviewing an initial set of profiles together so that they are on agreement on what the ideal profiles are for the role. 

As LinkedIn begins to surface batches of candidates that meet this criteria, Recruiter and Hiring manager will decide how to share and review profiles together going forward.

Hiring Manager and Recruiter will also determine their outreach strategy regarding how to engage with ideal profiles. Typically the recruiter will do the initial outreach via inmail or email and then set up an intro call. At times it may be appropriate for the recruiter to request the hiring manager to message potential profiles.

Only candidates we decide to engage will be added into Greenhouse.
