## **Talent Acquisition Metrics**

Our Talent Metrics approach is to support our leader's ability to define talent needs, drive decisions using data, and attract & retain the best external and internal talent. We strive to create an amazing candidate to teammate experience, and data drives continuous iteration!

**The two pillars of our Talent Metrics strategy include:**

- Transparency into real-time data through self-service reporting tools
- Adhoc reporting and insights

**Tools:**

- [TalentWall](https://app.talentwall.io/dashboard/dashboards/7012): Provides key recruiting metrics in real-time to all teammates
- [Greenhouse Reporting:](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360007315491-Greenhouse-Recruiting-reports-index) We leverage our ATS data and reports for interview calibration, the [Requisition Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SyrAInHn12g2W1USfhWvDZSfLe0_VPM3Re_ImgM6nq4/edit#gid=815618435ZtaACJxwjEu4my_xeYuB3a7E/edit#gid=1829575136), and more.

### What we measure:

#### Diversity lifecycle: applications, recruited, interviewed, offers extended & offers accepted

- The talent acquisition workflow [metrics](https://app.ashbyhq.com/home/dashboard-99c39b44-6c73-4492-a53c-f1551fe1e188) are specific to candidates who self-identified as coming from an underrepresented group.
- _Diversity_ refers to the characteristics of the people who make up Sourcegraph and how they identify. Race, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, national origin, disability, and sexual orientation are _some_ examples of how the data might be categorized when looking at Sourcegraph’s diversity.

#### Offer acceptance rate

- **Metric definition:** The percentage of offers extended that are accepted
- **Measurement:** Total offers accepted ÷ total offers extended X 100
- **Metric use:** Measure recruiting effectiveness at candidate conversion and determine the strength of our offers for different positions
- **Target:** >90%

#### Average time to hire (days)

- **Metric definition:** The average number of days between the application date and the date the candidate is marked as hired
- **Measurement:** Total time taken to complete the individual component of the hiring process for all requisitions ÷ total number of requisitions
- **Metric use:** Calibrate the timeliness and efficiency of the recruiting process. Identify components of the hiring process that need improvement.
- **Target:** <30 days
- **Note:** We tend to keep candidates in the mix when they are not a fit for an immediate opening but _are_ a fit for a position that will be opened in the near future (within 30 days).
  - If it takes more than 30 days to transfer a candidate to a new req, then the application date should reflect the day that the candidate was transferred to the new req. This should occur automatically in Greenhouse and doesn't require recruiters to manually update it.
  - If it takes less than 30 days to open the new req that is a better fit for the candidate, then recruiters should ensure that the candidate's application date reflects the date that they applied for the original req. Recruiters will need to manually do this on the new req by clicking the pencil icon next to "Applied on":

#### Average time to fill (days)

- **Measurement:** Total days to fill ÷ total offers accepted
- **Metric use:** Calibrate the timeliness and efficiency of the recruiting process
- **Target:** <45 days

#### Recruitment source breakdown

- **Metric definition:** Measure the distribution of external hires by recruitment source, including referral, rehire, agency, etc.
- **Measurement:** Total number of external hires for each source group ÷ external hires X 100
- **Metric use:** Evaluate the effectiveness of sourcing channels to understand their impact on retention and monitor recruitment costs

#### Recruiter effectiveness

- **Metric definition:** The volume of recruiter screens required to make a hire.
- **Measurement:** Number of candidates interviewed (interview scheduled or scorecard submitted) in these stages ÷ the number of candidates who received offers. The date filter is by the interview date, or scorecard submitted date if no interview was scheduled.
- **Metric use:** Evaluate sourcing quality and recruiter efficiency
- **Target:** 12:1

### Candidate experience

- **Metric definition:** An indication of how satisfied candidates and recent hires were with the recruiting process
