# **Talent Acquisition Metrics**

Our Talent Metrics approach is to support our leader's ability to define talent needs, drive decisions using data, and attract & retain the best external and internal talent. We strive to create an amazing candidate to teammate experience, and data drives continuous iteration!

**The two pillars of our Talent Metrics strategy include:**

- Transparency into real-time data through self-service reporting tools 
- Adhoc reporting and insights 

**Tools:**

- [TalentWall](https://app.talentwall.io/dashboard/dashboards/7012): Provides key recruiting metrics in real-time to all teammates
- [Greenhouse Reporting:](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360007315491-Greenhouse-Recruiting-reports-index) We leverage our ATS data and reports for interview calibration, candidate experience feedback, job board performance, and more. 
- [Company-Wide Recruiting Update](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HaLmhYEqopD322_97GR172x4E_pvvEGmwXMiWaCwakY/edit#gid=1156832169): This is an Excel doc showing our current open roles. 

## What we measure:

### Diversity lifecycle: applications, interviewed, offers extended & offers accepted

- The Talent team uses [Greenhouse's Pipeline by demographic report](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360007254531-Pipeline-by-demographic-report) to track candidate's demographic data.
- _Diversity_ refers to the characteristics of the people who make up Sourcegraph and how they identify. Race/ethnicity, gender, and veteran status are examples of how the data is categorized when looking at Sourcegraph’s diversity.

### Offer acceptance rate

- **Metric definition:** The percentage of offers extended that are accepted
- **Measurement:** Total offers accepted ÷ total offers extended X 100
- **Metric use:** Measure recruiting effectiveness at candidate conversion and determine the strength of our offers for different positions
- **Target:** >90%

### Time to hire 

- **Metric definition:** The average number of days between the application date and the date the candidate is marked as hired
- **Measurement:** Total time taken to complete the individual component of the hiring process for all requisitions ÷ total number of requisitions
- **Metric use:** Calibrate the timeliness and efficiency of the recruiting process. Identify components of the hiring process that need improvement.
- **Target:** <30 days
- **Note:** We tend to keep candidates in the mix when they are not a fit for an immediate opening but _are_ a fit for a position that will be opened in the near future (within 30 days).
  - If it takes more than 30 days to transfer a candidate to a new req, then the application date should reflect the day that the candidate was transferred to the new req. This should occur automatically in Greenhouse and doesn't require recruiters to manually update it.
  - If it takes less than 30 days to open the new req that is a better fit for the candidate, then recruiters should ensure that the candidate's application date reflects the date that they applied for the original req. Recruiters will need to manually do this on the new req by clicking the pencil icon next to "Applied on":

### Time to fill 

- **Metric definition:** Average number of days elapsed between requisition kick-off date and offer acceptance for internal and external hires
- **Measurement:** Total days to fill ÷ total offers accepted
- **Metric use:** Calibrate the timeliness and efficiency of the recruiting process

### Time to offer

- **Metric definition:** Average number of days between the date a candidate’s application was created and the date their offer was created (not the date the candidate was moved into offer stage).

### Time to start

- **Metric definition:** Average number of days between when an application was created and the candidates's scheduled start date. 
- **Target:** <60 days

### Time to accept 

- **Metric definition:** Average number of days between the date an offer was created and the date a candidate accepted the offer. 
- **Target:** <5 days

### Position vacancy time

- **Metric definition:** Average number of days between the date a job was opened in Greenhouse and the candidates's scheduled start date.
- **Target:** <95 days 

### Recruitment source breakdown

- **Metric definition:** Measure the distribution of external hires by recruitment source, including referral, rehire, agency, etc.
- **Measurement:** Total number of external hires for each source group ÷ external hires X 100

### Recruiter effectiveness

- **Metric definition:** The volume of recruiter screens required to make a hire.
- **Measurement:** Number of candidates interviewed (interview scheduled or scorecard submitted) in these stages ÷ the number of candidates who received offers. The date filter is by the interview date, or scorecard submitted date if no interview was scheduled.
- **Metric use:** Evaluate sourcing quality and recruiter efficiency
- **Target:** 12:1

### Candidate experience

- **Metric definition:** An indication of how satisfied candidates and recent hires were with the recruiting process
- **Measurement:** Candidate perceptions, measured through a survey
- **Metric use:** Expose gaps in the recruiting process that may cause a loss of quality to the candidates experience. Understand how to improve the recruiting process and itterate on feedback.
