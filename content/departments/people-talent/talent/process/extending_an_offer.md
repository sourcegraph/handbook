## Offer stage

**Step 1:** once finalist is identified, Recruiter completes references if necessary.

- Learn more about our reference check philosophy [here](../process/reference_check_questions.md)

**Step 2**: the Recruiter confirms level and compensation via Slack with Hiring Manager, Department Head, and Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable).

- [Compensation philosophy](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/index.md#components-of-compensation).

**Step 3**: the Recruiter has a pre-closing conversation with the candidate to confirm mutual-interest. It is very important that the Recruiter makes no offer promises or commitments to the candidate until the offer has been formally approved in Greenhouse.

**Step 4**: the Recruiter [creates an offer in Greenhouse](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200721744-Create-offer)

- The offer start date **must** align with a [cohort start date](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y182OTdwMnZyMnA3cmJnYzNrMTRiODAwc2gxZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), which take place every 2-weeks.
  - If you need to start a Teammate on a non-cohort date, you must receive approval from VP Talent. To receive approval, please send a Slack to VP Talent, Jonathan and Ines with business case for starting on a non-cohort date.
- Recruiter inputs number of equity options into the Stock Option Calculator, and transfers information into offer in Greenhouse.
- Approval chain: Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable) > VP Talent > Hiring Manager > Department Head > VP Operations and/or Manager, Financial Planning & Analysis.
- We want to hire people who overwhelmingly get `Yes` and `Strong Yes` feedback. If the candidate did not receive all `Yes` or `Strong Yes` feedback, the Hiring Manager or Recruiter needs to submit written justification for moving forward with offer in the offer approval section.
  - If the candidate received a `no` during the values interview, follow [these steps](../process/evaluating_values.md#resources-for-recruiters).

**Step 5**: once the offer is **fully approved** in Greenhouse, Recruiter schedules an offer summary call using the email template in Greenhouse. The purpose of the offer summary call is to review our offer with the candidate and answer any questions they may have.

- Attendees: Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate.
- To generate the offer summary, click "generate" in the Offer Details section of the candidate's Greenhouse profile, and select the appropriate offer summary.
- Recruiter will download the offer summary as a Word Doc, and convert to PDF. Recruiter will then send to the Hiring Manager and Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable) for review.
- Offer Summary call agenda:
  - The Hiring Manager kicks off the call to give the candidate feedback and tell why we’re excited about them.
  - The Recruiter then shares their screen to display the offer summary document.
  - The Recruiter then covers our compensation philosophy, the compensation specifics, perks, travel (and benefits, if applicable), and equity.
  - The Hiring Manager and Recruiter answer any questions and ask how the candidate is feeling about the opportunity.
  - Before ending the call, be sure to 1) determine a potential start date (all start dates should fall on a cohort Monday and any exceptions to that rule require approval from VP of Talent and People Ops) and 2) schedule a follow-up call to answer any questions.

**Step 6**: following the offer call, the Recruiter sends the offer summary to the candidate in an email, and Cc's the Hiring Manager, VP Talent and Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable).

**Step 7**: once the candidate verbally accepts the offer, the Recruiter follows the below steps:

- If US-based candidate: make a formal request in the Slack channel `talent-scheduling-and-offers` for an offer letter to be sent via DocuSign.
- If a Contractor candidate: make a formal request in the Slack channel `talent-scheduling-and-offers` for an offer letter to be sent via DocuSign.
- If onboarding via a PEO, make a formal request in the Slack channel #peo-visa-hiring to begin the PEO onboarding process (example below).

Hi team - we have a candidate based in `location` that we would like to onboard via Remote. Can we please initiate the process?

- Candidate's full legal name:
- Candidate's personal email:
- Country of residence:
- Do they require visa sponsorship to work in their country of residence? If so, what visa?
- Job title:
- Job description link:
- Compensation in USD (we will need to convert this to their local currency):
- Provide commission plan if applicable to the role:
- Job level:
- Will they be an IC or Manager?
- Start date:
- Hiring Manager (full name):

**Step 8**: the candidate receives the offer.

- For US-based offers, the Recruiting Operations Specialist will send the `US-offer template` via DocuSign.
- For non-US based offers (Contractors), the Recruiting Operations Specialist will confirm the correct template and will send via DocuSign.
  - All DocuSigns should be routed for signing to VP Talent > Candidate and Cc Recruiting@sourcegraph.com, Onboarding@sourcegraph.com and the Hiring Manager
- For PEO candidates, the candidate will receive all offer documentation via the PEO.

## What do to if candidate declines our offer

If a candidate declines our offer, the Recruiter will follow the processes below.

Note: If the candidate initially signs the offer letter and is marked as hired then revokes the offer, please follow the steps to [Action a Revoked Offer](./after_the_offer.md).

**Step 1:** The Recruiter will send a Slack in the role’s private hiring channel to inform the Hiring Manager and the Interview team that the candidate has declined the offer and discuss steps.

- Things to consider: What was the reason for the offer decline? Discuss with the Hiring Manager whether we need to adjust anything about the offer, scope of the role, etc.

**Step 2:** The Recruiter will reject the candidate who declined the offer in Greenhouse and select the most appropriate ‘They Rejected Us’ reason from the drop-down menu. Add details about the situation and reasoning in the Note section.

- Example:
  - Reason: “Accepted a competing offer ($25K+ higher)”
  - Note: “Accepted a competing offer at X company with $X OTE and $X equity"

**Step 3:** The Recruiter will discuss next steps with the Hiring Manager. Were there other finalists the team was excited about that they would like to extend the offer to now? Were there any other candidates in process that we’d like to complete the interviews? If not, the Recruiter will begin sourcing and recruiting to rebuild the pipeline.
