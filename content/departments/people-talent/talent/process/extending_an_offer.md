## Offer stage

**Step 1:** once finalist is identified, Recruiter completes references if necessary.

- Learn more about our reference check philosophy [here](../process/reference_check_questions.md)

**Step 2**: the Recruiter confirms level and compensation via Slack with Hiring Manager, Department Head, and Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable).

- [Compensation philosophy](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/index.md#components-of-compensation).

**Step 3**: the Recruiter has a pre-closing conversation with the candidate to confirm mutual-interest. It is very important that the Recruiter makes no offer promises or commitments to the candidate until the offer has been formally approved in Greenhouse.

- [Counter offers and how to deal with them](#counter-offers-and-how-to-deal-with-them)

**Step 4**: the Recruiter [creates an offer in Greenhouse](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200721744-Create-offer)

- The offer start date **must** align with a [cohort start date](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y182OTdwMnZyMnA3cmJnYzNrMTRiODAwc2gxZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), which take place every 2-weeks.
  - If you need to start a Teammate on a non-cohort date, you must receive approval from VP Talent. To receive approval, please send a Slack to VP Talent, Jonathan and Ines with business case for starting on a non-cohort date.
- Recruiter inputs number of equity options into the Stock Option Calculator, and transfers information into offer in Greenhouse.
- Approval chain: Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable) > VP Talent > Hiring Manager > Department Head > VP Operations and/or Manager, Financial Planning & Analysis.
- We want to hire people who overwhelmingly get `Yes` and `Strong Yes` feedback. If the candidate did not receive all `Yes` or `Strong Yes` feedback, the Hiring Manager or Recruiter needs to submit written justification for moving forward with offer in the offer approval section.
  - If the candidate received a `no` during the values interview, follow [these steps](../process/evaluating_values.md#resources-for-recruiters).

**Step 5**: once the offer is **fully approved** in Greenhouse, Recruiter schedules an offer summary call using the email template in Greenhouse. The purpose of the offer summary call is to review our offer with the candidate and answer any questions they may have.

- Attendees: Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate.
- Duration: Each candidate offer summary call will be slightly different, time estimates below are included as approximation to ensure all points are covered.
- Preparation:

  - To generate the offer summary, click "generate" in the Offer Details section of the candidate's Greenhouse profile, and select the appropriate offer summary.
  - Recruiter will download the offer summary as a Word Doc and then will convert to PDF. Recruiter will then send to the Hiring Manager and Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable) for review. -**Important note:** If you do not download the summary as a Word Doc first and then convert to PDF, the icons and formatting will have errors.
  - Recruiter will check previously discussed start date and make sure it still falls on a Cohort start date. If it does not, before the end of the call the recruiter must be sure to determine a potential alternative start date (all start dates should fall on a cohort Monday and any exceptions to that rule require approval from VP of Talent and People Ops)
  - Recruiting and Hiring Manager calibrate prior to offer call so they are aligned on how best to approach the call.
  - Recruiter and Hiring Manager should pick 3-4 of their favorite quotes about the candidate from scorecards submitted by interviewers during the process to reiterate excitement of the potential of them joining the team.

- Offer Summary call goals:

  - Convey to candidates how excited we are about the prospect of them joining the team and how much value they will add to Sourcegraph.
  - Ensure candidates have a good understanding of our compensation philosophy, their salary, perks, travel (and benefits, if applicable) and equity.
  - Answer any questions the candidate has and gauge how the candidate is feeling about the opportunity.
  - Determine a start date and schedule a follow-up call to answer any questions.

- Offer Summary Call Walkthrough:

  - (2 min) The Hiring Manager or Recruiter kicks off the call to give the candidate feedback and tell them why we’re excited about them. They will read a few of their favorite feedback quotes from the interviewers.
  - (~15 min) Recruiter shares their screen to display the offer summary document and will walk through each slide with the candidate. After each slide, Recruiter will ask the candidate if they have any questions about the information displayed. **Important to ensure the Offer Summary Call is interactive and not a presentation**

  - Slides that the recruiter will cover:

    - **Total Rewards Summary**
    - **Your Offer - At a Glance**
    - **Your Offer - Perks**
    - **Your Offer - Benefits (If applicable)**
    - **Your Offer - Stock Options**
    - **Hypothetical Stock Option Scenarios**

  - (~10 min) Recruiter will ask the candidate how they are feeling about the offer and opportunity to gauge the chances of closing the candidate. Asks if they feel comfortable to verbally commit.

    - If Yes
      - Recruiter reconfirms with candidate a previously discussed start date.
      - Recruiter covers following topics (Docusign, Welcome email from People Ops, New Hire Video) etc.
    - If No
      - Recruiter will ask to address any concerns on the call.
      - If candidate needs time to think through the offer, Recruiter will schedule a follow up call with candidate within 24 hours.

  - (1 min) Recruiter informs the candidate that they will send a copy of the offer summary right after the call and to reach out if any questions come up. Recruiter and Hiring Manager reiterate excitement.

  **For Recruiters**: To see an actual offer summary call script, click [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ny8dtNN0VHhawhs_YOCxDJPs2zwuLTv9uvj1n2VkxGM/edit?usp=sharing).

**Step 6**: Following the offer call, the Recruiter sends the offer summary to the candidate in an email, and Cc's the Hiring Manager, VP Talent and Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable).

**Step 7**: Once the candidate verbally accepts the offer, the Recruiter follows the below steps:

- If US-based candidate: make a formal request in the Slack channel `talent-scheduling-and-offers` for an offer letter to be sent via DocuSign.

  1. In the slack channel you will go to the message box and click on the _Attachments & shortcuts_ button (the cross icon).
  2. You will see a section called _Workflows for this channel_ with two options: _Scheduling Request_ and _Offer Request_
  3. Click on _Offer Request_ and fill out the form.
  4. Click 'Submit' once you're done.

- If onboarding via a PEO, make a formal request in the Slack channel #peo-visa-hiring to begin the PEO onboarding process (example below).

Hi team - we have a candidate based in `location` that we would like to onboard via Remote. Can we please initiate the process?

- Candidate's full legal name:
- Candidate's personal email:
- Country of residence:
- Do they require visa sponsorship to work in their country of residence? If so, what visa?
- Job title:
- Job description link:
- Compensation in USD (we will need to convert this to their local currency):
- Provide commission plan if applicable to the role:
- Job level:
- Will they be an IC or Manager?
- Start date:
- Hiring Manager (full name):

**Step 8**: The offer letter is officially [generated](../tools/resources_for_recruiting_operations.md#how-to-generate-an-offer-letter) and the candidate receives the offer.

- For US-based offers, the Recruiting Operations Specialist will send the `US-offer template` via DocuSign.
- For non-US based offers (Contractors), the Recruiting Operations Specialist will confirm the correct template and will send via DocuSign.
  - All DocuSigns should be routed for signing to VP Talent > Candidate and Cc Recruiting@sourcegraph.com, Onboarding@sourcegraph.com and the Hiring Manager
- For PEO candidates, the candidate will receive all offer documentation via the PEO.

### Offer Process for PEO/EOR contracts

Our **Default position** is to hire new teammates as contractors, as opposed to hiring via PEO.

- The exception is the UK. For new hires in the UK, we will hire these teammates via PEO
- If a new teammate requests to be hired via a PEO, and that teammate is _not_ based in the UK, then the finance team will review this request.

  - **Step 1:** The talent team should set the expectation with the candidate (non US based candidates) that Sourcegraph wishes to engage that candidate as a contractor. This should be completed as early as possible in the hiring process.

  - **Step 2:** If a candidate informs the talent team that they wish to be hired via a PEO, then the talent team should request approval from the Finance. This should be communicated at the #finance-talent-collab channel

  - **Step 3:** Finance will review the cost implications, as well as the implications associated with taking on additional headcount in certain countries.
  - **Step 4** Finance will aim to respond within 24 hours.
    - Should additional approvals be required, Finance will initiate this part of the process.
  - **Step 5:** Follow [PEO Onboarding Process](after_the_offer.md#onboarding-process-for-peo-hires)

- For Talent & People teammembers: You can read more about the process [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LIXOhvAmNjjiGV5oB0x3iRDrsjBkB0cbhSFGttCYCyo/edit?usp=sharing)

## What do to if candidate declines our offer

If a candidate declines our offer, the Recruiter will follow the processes below.

Note: If the candidate initially signs the offer letter and is marked as hired then revokes the offer, please follow the steps to [Action a Revoked Offer](./after_the_offer.md#actioning-a-revoked-offer).

**Step 1:** The Recruiter will send a Slack in the role’s private hiring channel to inform the Hiring Manager and the Interview team that the candidate has declined the offer and discuss steps.

- Things to consider: What was the reason for the offer decline? Discuss with the Hiring Manager whether we need to adjust anything about the offer, scope of the role, etc.

**Step 2:** The Recruiter will reject the candidate who declined the offer in Greenhouse and select the most appropriate ‘They Rejected Us’ reason from the drop-down menu. Add details about the situation and reasoning in the Note section.

- Example:
  - Reason: “Accepted a competing offer ($25K+ higher)”
  - Note: “Accepted a competing offer at X company with $X OTE and $X equity"

**Step 3:** The Recruiter will discuss next steps with the Hiring Manager. Were there other finalists the team was excited about that they would like to extend the offer to now? Were there any other candidates in process that we’d like to complete the interviews? If not, the Recruiter will begin sourcing and recruiting to rebuild the pipeline.

## Counter-offers and how to deal with them

Counter-offers are part of the recruitment process and cannot be fully avoided, so it is best to learn how to reduce the risk of counter-offers during the recruitment process.

### What is a counter offer and why do they happen?

A counter-offer is an offer made in response to another offer. In a recruitment scenario, it is when the current employer of the candidate reacts to the candidate’s decision to resign. They do this by making an offer, a counter-offer, usually better than the offer we made. The 3 most common components are:

- **More money** – Simply an increase in salary
- **Promotion** – That promotion that the candidate has been chasing
- **Benefits** – More equity, more vacation etc.

### Why make a counter offer?

There are a few reasons why employers make counter offers:

- **The cost of recruitment and training** – Recruiting and training a new employee is expensive
- **Loss of income** – The candidate is working on something important or the loss of the employee will impact the workload for the remaining team.
- **Pride** – Some companies simply do not like losing talent to the competition.

### Managing a counter offer

How do you manage a counter-offer? There are two important factors:

- **Build rapport** - As you go through the process, build trust with the candidate. You are the subject expert matter so they will trust your opinion. As you build a relationship, you will learn about their goals, motivations and pain points, and the pull and push factors. This will have a big impact if they either accept or reject the offer.
- **Know your business space** - This will help you build trust but also allow you to use market insight to show the candidate that things won’t improve if they stay or to remind them why they wanted to switch roles to begin with. Maybe they are leaving a legacy space that has not seen growth for the last few years.

It is important to understand that counter offers are not always a bad proposition so understanding both the pull and push factors are very important. You don’t want to focus on the push factors if the candidate is more interested in the career growth potential.

### Best practices

- Always make yourself available to speak with the candidate. Be ready to schedule a zoom/phone call. Never do it over email since it is too easy to ignore.

- Listen to what the candidate has to say without dismissing their thoughts. You will use the information they share with you to build your case and make your list of pull and push factors.

- If they ask for time to think, ask them to schedule time to speak with you before making a decision. If you have built a rapport with them, this should not be a problem.

- Leverage stakeholders. Who did they click with? Find out and leverage them in the conversation or have them speak directly to the candidate.

- Be patient and empathetic. Changing your job is a big decision and some people need more time than others.

- Throughout the interview process always remember ABC: Always Be Closing! Every conversation with the candidate should be a closing conversation. If the process has been done correctly, there should not be any surprises at the end. If there are concerns, we should be ready to address them right away.

- Sometimes you have to let them go. In the end, you want to work with passionate and motivated people. It is good to know when to cut your losses.
