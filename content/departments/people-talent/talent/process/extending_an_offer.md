- [How to onboard a new hire after offer acceptance](./after_the_offer.md)

## Offer stage

**Step 1:** Once finalist is identified, Recruiter completes references if necessary.

- Learn more about our reference check philosophy [here](../process/reference_check_questions.md)

**Step 2**: The Recruiter confirms level and compensation via Slack with Hiring Manager, Department Head, and Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable).

- [Compensation philosophy](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/index.md#components-of-compensation).

**Step 3**: The Recruiter has a pre-closing conversation with the candidate to confirm mutual-interest. It is very important that the Recruiter makes no offer promises or commitments to the candidate until the offer has been formally approved in Greenhouse.

- [Counter-offers and how to deal with them](#counter-offers-and-how-to-deal-with-them)

**Step 4**: The Recruiter [creates an offer in Greenhouse](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200721744-Create-offer)

- The offer start date **must** align with a [cohort start date](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y182OTdwMnZyMnA3cmJnYzNrMTRiODAwc2gxZ0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), which take place every 2-weeks.
  - If you need to start a Teammate on a non-cohort date, you must receive approval from VP People & Talent. To receive approval, please send a Slack to VP People & Talent, Director, People and Onboarding Manager with business case for starting on a non-cohort date.
- Recruiter inputs number of equity options into the Stock Option Calculator, and transfers information into offer in Greenhouse.
- Approval chain: VP People & Talent > Hiring Manager > Department Head > VP Operations and/or Manager, Financial Planning & Analysis > CEO (Quinn Slack)
- We want to hire people who overwhelmingly get `Yes` and `Strong Yes` feedback. If the candidate did not receive all `Yes` or `Strong Yes` feedback, the Hiring Manager or Recruiter needs to submit written justification for moving forward with offer in the offer approval section.
  - If the candidate received a `No` during the values interview, follow [these steps](../process/evaluating_values.md#resources-for-recruiters).

**Step 5**: Once the offer is **fully approved** in Greenhouse, Recruiter schedules an [offer summary call](extending_an_offer.md#offer-summary-call) using the email template in Greenhouse.

- The offer summary should be downloaded as a Microsoft Word document to ensure that it contains the correct formatting. Recruiters, please download Microsoft Word prior to sharing the offer summary with candidates.

**Step 6**: Following the offer summary call, the Recruiter sends the offer summary to the candidate in an email, and Cc's the Hiring Manager, VP Talent and Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable).

**Step 7**: Once the candidate verbally accepts the offer, the Recruiter follows the below steps:

- For US-based and non-US based (Non-PEO/EOR) candidates: make a formal request in the Slack channel #talent-scheduling-and-offers for an offer letter to be sent via DocuSign.

  - **Step 1:** In the slack channel you will go to the message box and click on the _Attachments & shortcuts_ button (the cross icon).
  - **Step 2:** You will see a section called _Workflows for this channel_ with two options: _Scheduling Request_ and _Offer Request_
  - **Step 3:** Click on _Offer Request_ and fill out the form.
  - **Step 4:** Click 'Submit' once you're done.

- For non-US Based candidates hired via PEO: You should have already gone through the [process of having the PEO request approved](extending_an_offer.md#offer-process-for-peoeor-contracts). You will make a formal offer letter request in the Slack channel #peo-visa-hiring-exceptions to begin the PEO onboarding process (example below).

  Hi team - we have a candidate based in `location` that we would like to onboard via Deel. Can we please initiate the process?

  - Candidate's full legal name:
  - Candidate's personal email:
  - Country of residence:
  - Do they require visa sponsorship to work in their country of residence? If so, what visa?
  - Job title:
  - Job description link:
  - Compensation in USD (we will need to convert this to their local currency):
  - Provide commission plan if applicable to the role:
  - Job level:
  - Will they be an IC or Manager?
  - Start date:
  - Hiring Manager (full name):

**Step 8**: The offer letter is officially [generated](../tools/resources_for_recruiting_operations.md#how-to-generate-an-offer-letter) and the candidate receives the offer.

- For US-based offers, the Recruiting Operations Specialist will send the `US-offer template` via DocuSign.
- For non-US based offers, the Recruiting Operations Specialist will confirm the correct template and will send via DocuSign.
  - All DocuSigns should be routed for signing to VP People & Talent > Candidate and Cc Recruiting@sourcegraph.com, Onboarding@sourcegraph.com and the Hiring Manager
- For PEO candidates, the candidate will receive all offer documentation via the PEO.

### Offer summary call

- **Attendees:** Recruiter, Hiring Manager, Candidate.

- **Duration:** Each candidate offer summary call will be slightly different, time estimates below are included as approximation to ensure all points are covered.
- **Preparation:**

  - Have your offer summary created and ready to present
    - **Step 1:** Create the offer summary by clicking "Generate" in the Offer Details section of the candidate's Greenhouse profile, and select the appropriate offer summary.
    - **Step 2:** Recruiter will download the offer summary as a Word Doc and then convert to PDF. Recruiter will then send to the Hiring Manager and Director, Technical Recruiting (if applicable) for review.
    - **Note:** If you do not download the summary as a Word Doc first and then convert to PDF, the icons and formatting will have errors.
  - Check that the previously discussed start date still falls on a Cohort start date.
    - If it does not, the Recruiter must be sure to find an alternative date during the summary call. Any exceptions to that rule require prior approval.
  - Recruiter and Hiring Manager should calibrate on alignment regarding how best to approach the call.
  - Recruiter and Hiring Manager should pick 3-4 of their favorite quotes about the candidate from scorecards submitted by interviewers during the process to reiterate excitement of the potential of them joining the team.

- **Offer summary call goals**

  **Note for Recruiters:** you can practice an offer summary call by reading a [sample script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ny8dtNN0VHhawhs_YOCxDJPs2zwuLTv9uvj1n2VkxGM/edit?usp=sharing)

### Offer process for PEO/EOR contracts

- If a new teammate are required to be hired via a PEO/EOR, the finance team will review this request before it is processed.

  - **Step 1:** The talent team should set the expectation with the candidate (non US based candidates) on our PEO/EOR onboarding process. This should be completed as early as possible in the hiring process.

  - **Step 2:** If a candidate required to be hired via a PEO/EOR, then the talent team should request approval from finance. This should be communicated to the #finance-talent-collab channel.

  - **Step 3:** Finance will review the cost implications, as well as the implications associated with taking on additional headcount in certain countries.
  - **Step 4** Finance will aim to respond within 24 hours.
    - Should additional approvals be required, Finance will initiate this part of the process.
  - **Step 5:** Follow [PEO onboarding process](after_the_offer.md#onboarding-process-for-peo-hires)

- Talent & People team members can read more about our international hiring process in the [source of truth documentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LIXOhvAmNjjiGV5oB0x3iRDrsjBkB0cbhSFGttCYCyo/edit?usp=sharing).

## What do to if the candidate declines our offer

If a candidate declines our offer, the Recruiter will follow the processes below:

Note: If the candidate initially signs the offer letter and is marked as hired then revokes the offer, please follow the steps to [Action a Revoked Offer](./after_the_offer.md#actioning-a-revoked-offer).

**Step 1:** The Recruiter will send a Slack in the role’s private hiring channel to inform the Hiring Manager and the Interview team that the candidate has declined the offer and discuss steps.

- Things to consider: What was the reason for the offer decline? Discuss with the Hiring Manager whether we need to adjust anything about the offer, scope of the role, etc.

**Step 2:** The Recruiter will reject the candidate who declined the offer in Greenhouse and select the most appropriate ‘They Rejected Us’ reason from the drop-down menu. Add details about the situation and reasoning in the Note section.

- Example:
  - Reason: “Accepted a competing offer ($25K+ higher)”
  - Note: “Accepted a competing offer at X company with $X OTE and $X equity"

**Step 3:** The Recruiter will discuss next steps with the Hiring Manager. Were there other finalists the team was excited about that they would like to extend the offer to now? Were there any other candidates in process that we’d like to complete the interviews? If not, the Recruiter will begin sourcing and recruiting to rebuild the pipeline.

## Counter-offers and how to deal with them

Counter-offers are part of the recruitment process and cannot be fully avoided, so it is best to learn how to reduce the risk of counter-offers during the recruitment process.

### What is a counter-offer and why do they happen?

A counter-offer is an offer made in response to another offer. In a recruitment scenario, it is when the current employer of the candidate reacts to the candidate’s decision to resign. They do this by making an offer, a counter-offer, usually better than the offer we made. The 3 most common components are:

- **More money** – Simply an increase in salary
- **Promotion** – That promotion that the candidate has been chasing
- **Benefits** – More equity, more vacation etc.

### Why make a counter-offer?

There are a few reasons why employers make counter-offers:

- **The cost of recruitment and training** – Recruiting and training a new employee is expensive.
- **Loss of income** – The candidate is working on something important or the loss of the employee will impact the workload for the remaining team.
- **Pride** – Some companies simply do not like losing talent to the competition.

### Managing a counter-offer

How do you manage a counter-offer? There are two important factors:

- **Build rapport** - As you go through the process, build trust with the candidate. You are the subject expert matter so they will trust your opinion. As you build a relationship, you will learn about their goals, motivations and pain points, and the pull and push factors. This will have a big impact if they either accept or reject the offer.
- **Know your business space** - This will help you build trust but also allow you to use market insight to show the candidate that things won’t improve if they stay or to remind them why they wanted to switch roles to begin with. Maybe they are leaving a legacy space that has not seen growth for the last few years.

It is important to understand that counter-offers are not always a bad proposition so understanding both the pull and push factors are very important. You don’t want to focus on the push factors if the candidate is more interested in the career growth potential.

### Best practices

- Always make yourself available to speak with the candidate. Be ready to schedule a Zoom/phone call. Never do it over email since it is too easy to ignore.

- Listen to what the candidate has to say without dismissing their thoughts. You will use the information they share with you to build your case and make your list of pull and push factors.

- If they ask for time to think, ask them to schedule time to speak with you before making a decision. If you have built a rapport with them, this should not be a problem.

- Leverage stakeholders. Who did they click with? Find out and leverage them in the conversation or have them speak directly to the candidate.

- Be patient and empathetic. Changing your job is a big decision and some people need more time than others.

- Throughout the interview process always remember ABC: Always Be Closing! Every conversation with the candidate should be a closing conversation. If the process has been done correctly, there should not be any surprises at the end. If there are concerns, we should be ready to address them right away.

- Sometimes you have to let them go. In the end, you want to work with passionate and motivated people. It is good to know when to cut your losses.
