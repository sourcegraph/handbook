# Types of interviews

The below information is intended to help our candidates prepare for each step of the interview. Please note that the example questions are **examples only** and may not be the exact questions asked in the actual interview process.

## The interview process

Our hiring managers work with their [assigned recruiter](../index.md#talent-team-members) to create an optimal interview plan for their role. Below is an example. All steps in bold are strongly encouraged.

All role-specific interview processes are documented at the end of each [job description](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91).
We strive for consistency across all interviews.

- **Recruiter Screen**
- **Hiring Manager Screen**
- Assignment, if applicable
- Team Interview stage:
  - Resume Deep Dive
  - Assignment review/working session, if applicable
  - Technical Interview, if applicable
  - **Cross-functional Team Collaboration Interview**
  - **Peer Interview**
- Final Interview stage:
  - **Values Interview**
  - Leadership Interview
- Reference checks / offer

## Structured interview questions

We ask structured questions for all interviews, meaning that all candidates are asked the same questions in an effort to reduce bias and to even the playing-field. The interview [may be recorded](../tools/guide_to_using_brighthire.md) so that we can focus on the candidate, not taking notes, and ensure that we're delivering a great interview experience. If a candidate prefers not to be recorded during the interview, they can let us know—the structure of the interview and decision-making process will remain the same and the decision not to be recorded will have no weight on their candidacy.

# Universal interviews

All departments are likely to have some or all of the below universal interview stages:

## Recruiter Screen

- Interviewer: the assigned recruiter for the role.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Details: the goal of the recruiter screen is to learn more about your background and interest in Sourcegraph. In addition to learning about you, the recruiter will also tell you about Sourcegraph, the role, compensation/benefits, the interview process, and answer any questions you have.
- Example questions:
  - Tell me about your work experience, past to present.
  - Why are you looking for something new?
  - Why are you interested in Sourcegraph and our open position?
  - What are you looking for in your next role, and what are your career goals?
  - Do you have overlap with a specific time zone? (only applicable for roles that have time zone requirements)
  - Tell us how much exposure, if any, you have had working with teammates across time zones. How did you stay connected and up-to-date with your team?
  - What is your ideal start date?
  - Are your compensation expectations in line with our compensation range, which is XYZ?
  - What questions do you have for us?

## Hiring Manager Screen

- Interviewer: the hiring manager.
- Duration: 30-minutes is average, but sometimes these are longer.
- Details: during this stage in the interview process, the Hiring Manager will introduce themself, get to know you, and answer any initial questions you may have. This stage is meant to be conversational and informative for both us and the candidate.
- Example questions:
  - What did you do to prepare for this conversation?
  - Why do you want to be a [role title]? What are your long term goals?
  - How would you explain what Sourcegraph does to a friend?

## Resume Deep Dive

- Interviewer(s): the hiring manager or a peer leads the Resume deep dive, and sometimes there is another teammate who shadows the interview.
- Duration: 60-minutes.
- Details: a resume deep dive (often referred to as a "Topgrade Interview") is an interview style where we take a deep dive into a candidate's background, past to present. The goal of a resume deep dive is to uncover the motivation behind a candidate's decision making, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments in past roles. [Here](https://www.lever.co/blog/topgrading-interview-guide/) is a document to help guide expectations on this stage in the interview process. This is simply an example of what to expect, and does not represent the questions we will be asking.
- Example questions:
  - How did you find your job? Why did you choose to accept it?
  - Who hired you? What was their name? What did they hire you to do?
  - Why would your former boss say were your strengths and opportunities for growth?
  - What did you like most and least about your job?
  - What would your peers say about you?
  - What are you most proud of accomplishing while in your job?
  - Why did you leave?

## Peer Interview

- Interviewer(s): the other members of the team for which you're interviewing.
- Duration: 30–45 minutes.
- Details: during the peer interview, your potential future colleagues will assess if you will be a value-add to the team, take and give constructive criticism, and be an overall supportive team member. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions directed to your potential future peers.
- Example questions:
  - Tell us about the best team you've ever been a part of.
  - Tell us about a time when you had to put your team's interests above your own.

## Cross-functional Team Collaboration Interview

- Interviewer(s): people outside of your respective department who you would cross-collaborate with regularly.
- Duration: 30–60 minutes.
- Details: during this stage of the interview process, you will meet with members of another team with whom you would partner regularly. The goal of this interview is to understand how you communicate and collaborate with cross-functional partners within Sourcegraph.
- Example questions:
  - Tell us about a recent project you worked on where you collaborate with people outside of your department
  - Tell me about a project where you or your team had a disagreement with someone in another function

## Leadership Interview

- Interviewer: a member of the leadership team for the department.
- Duration: 30–45 minutes.
- Details: during this stage in the interview process, a member of the leadership team for the department will ask questions to gain more insight into the following areas: your grit, curiosity, passion, growth mindset, intelligence, and values. They will also answer any final questions you may have! This is generally the last stage in our interview process.
- Leadership interviews tend to vary by department, role, and leader. Your recruiter will prepare you and answer any questions you may have prior to the interview.

## Values Interview

Read more about our values interview [here](evaluating_values.md).

- Interviewers: two teammates outside of the department for which you're interviewing.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Details: this interview is focused entirely on our values and how a candidate's views and experiences align with them. Our values are key to our success as individuals and as a company. You can read more about them [here](../../../../company-info-and-process/values/index.md).
- Example questions: We will ask behavioral-based, open-ended questions directly related to our values.
  -Tell us about a time when you advocated for someone else
  -Tell us about a project you are most proud of completing

# Department specific interviews

In addition to the above interviews, some departments have department-specific interviews.

## Administrative

#### Executive Business Partner working session scenario

- Interviewer(s) Greg Bastis, VP of Sales
- Duration: 60-minutes.
- Details: The goal of this working session is to give us all a sense of what it would be like to work together. Below is a hypothetical situation that we would like to play out during this 60-minute session.

  You are new to the role (30 days) when Greg asks you to meet and discuss organizing an in-person event for the sales/marketing teams. The idea behind this event is to build strong relationships among team members and align on goals.

  Your objective in this meeting is to:

1.  Gather all the information that you need in order to be successful at planning and executing this event.
2.  Provide recommendations, share potential ideas, and discuss solutions with Greg.

Our advice:

- Don't go overboard on preparation or detail.
- Clever ideas are awesome and appreciated.
- We are also looking for your process/framework/principles.
- If you need to take notes, we usually use Google Docs!

Some background info:

- Team org: [Sales team](../../../sales/index.md) and [Marketing team](../../../marketing/index.md)
- [Publicly referenceable customer logos](https://about.sourcegraph.com/customers/)
- Everything at [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) and our [handbook](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com) should be assumed to be accurate and up to date.

A few pointers:

- Ask identifying questions about existing gaps on the team
- Be ready to identify immediate solutions
- Be prepared to have a dynamic conversation to uncover nuances about the teams you will be working with

## BizOps, Finance, Legal, TechOps

### BizOps: Director of Data & Analytics take-home project

- It’s 2021, and Sourcegraph is growing at a rapid pace. With the launch of Sourcegraph cloud and significant growth in sales of the existing self-hosted deployment option, the VP of Operations is asking you to prepare a plan for upgrading our data infrastructure to be prepared for the next several years of growth.
- We have a complex user journey that can touch a number of websites, apps, and integrations:
  - Data sources:
    - Websites
      - About.sourcegraph.com: Sourcegraph’s marketing website (pages include: a splash homepage, our blog, about us, contact us, press, careers, terms of service, etc.)
      - Learn.sourcegraph.com (learning and tutorials about code search)
      - Docs.sourcegraph.com (documentation)
      - Custom SEO landing pages
      - And more…
  - Core products:
    - Sourcegraph.com: The cloud product, used for searching across the universe of open source code and users’ private repositories. Can be used as an actual product destination or simply as a demo as needed.
    - Self-hosted Sourcegraph instances: Self-hosted webapps, using the same codebase as Sourcegraph.com, but deployed on-premises or in our customers’ private clouds. An example would be Uber’s private Sourcegraph instance—only accessible to Uber employees and contractors, and only containing Uber’s code. It would be accessible to Uber devs on an internal-only domain, like sourcegraph.uber.com.
  - Integrations:
    - Sourcegraph browser extensions: Chrome, Safari, and Firefox extensions that add Sourcegraph features to other websites where users view code (e.g. enhanced code views on sites like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and more).
    - Sourcegraph editor extensions: downloadable plugins for desktop code editors, such as VS Code, Atom, and Vim, that add some Sourcegraph features locally.
- Key notes:
  - The expectation for privacy is much higher for our downloaded products and self-hosted Sourcegraph instances. E.g. the customers who opt to host Sourcegraph themselves expect us not to track their users’ actions. Instead, we only collect aggregated telemetry from self-hosted Sourcegraph instances, with no individual user-level details.
  - Consumers of this user journey data include nearly every part of the company, from product (core app engagement and product usage data), engineering (application performance data), marketing and sales (top of funnel data and user engagement data for outreach), customer success (customer health and engagement), and more.
  - Our current traffic is ~100k monthly website visitors and cloud product users and ~40k monthly self-hosted instance users.
- Deliverables:
  - Please design a high-level, conceptual data pipeline that would serve our business’s needs. Please name specific recommended tools (or options) to serve at each step of the pipeline. No need to write descriptions of every step, but please be prepared to answer questions about them.
  - Please describe the basic structure of data at the beginning(s) and the end(s) of the pipeline, and be prepared to discuss the data transformations that take place along the way.
  - Finally, please draw or describe (no real data required) the dashboards or reports that you would recommend providing to the CEO, the head of Product, and the head of Marketing each month.
- We recommend that you spend approximately 2 hours on this case study. Please feel free to reach out with any questions!

### BizOps: Product Analyst take-home project

This exercise should take 2–3 hours to complete; please don’t take more than that!

  _ 1.Create an account if you don’t already have one
  _ 2.Click the green+in the top right (‘Create report’)to access the workspace \* 3.We’ll be using the following Mode Public Warehousetables to complete the exercise:tutorials.playbook_users,tutorials.playbook_events,tutorials.playbook_experiments,tutorials.playbook_emails
- Prompt: For each of the following questions please create charts and/or tables (within Mode or by exporting to a spreadsheet tool if that’s easier) to show your findings. We’re not expecting a slide deck or document to explain your findings, but quick summaries of charts, if needed, are just fine. Keep in mind that in most cases there are no “right” or “wrong” answers; we’re more interested in your approach and thought processes.
  _ 1. What company is most engaged with the product?
  _ 2. We ran an A/B test (experiment) to increase ‘like_message’ actions users are taking. Which variant would you recommend going forward with, if any?
- When you’ve completed the project, share your results via static run links along with some availability you have over the next week to review the project with a BizOps team member. When reviewing, you can expect questions about your approach in getting to know the data, the process you took to find the results, results themselves, and how you decided to communicate your findings.

### Legal: Corporate & Legal Counsel take-home project

The goal of the assignment is to give you a chance to demonstrate how you think, write, and negotiate while tackling issues that are top of mind for Sourcegraph and our customers.

- Please see the attached MSA redlines (we will provide this to you if you get to this stage in the process) from our prospective customer, a CA-based tech company. Deal summary:
  - On-premise instance
  - 100K USD ACV
- Will you respond to the redlines and include comments to the customer explaining your reasoning for any redlines that you reject or modify? Please accept any redlines that you suggest that we agree to with a brief comment explaining why.

#### SDR mock cold call

As part of the interview process we would like to do a 'mock cold-call'. Don't worry! We are not expecting you to be an expert (you will be after joining us, that's the fun part).

The important part is diving right in and having fun. At the end we will ask you how you think it went and provide some feedback as well. For who you are calling: feel free to select anyone, a good suggestion would be the prospect you wrote your cold email to (most people do this).

For structure:

- Permission based opener- get permission to continue the call
- Problem Statement- pique curiosity
- Closing- ask for the meeting

A great resource on structure (including some great walkthrough videos) from [Belal Batrawy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/belbatrawy/) are on [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zwe8VXXr2bazlHGLtR6zv_I0bxq-WPX5E_Go4DcCVKE/edit).
