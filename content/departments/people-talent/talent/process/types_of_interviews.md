# Types of interviews

The below information is intended to help our candidates prepare for each step of the interview. Please note that the example questions are **examples only** and may not be the exact questions asked in the actual interview process.

## The interview process

Our hiring managers work with their [assigned recruiter](../index.md#talent-team-members) to create an optimal interview plan for their role. Below is an example. All steps in bold are strongly encouraged.

All role-specific interview processes are documented at the end of each [job description](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91).
We strive for consistency across all interviews.

- **Recruiter Screen**
- **Hiring Manager Screen**
- **Resume Deep Dive**
- Assignment, if applicable
- Team Interview stage:
  - Assignment review/working session, if applicable
  - Technical Interview, if applicable
  - **Cross-functional Team Collaboration Interview**
  - **Peer Interview**
- Final Interview stage:
  - **Values Interview**
  - Leadership Interview
- Reference checks / offer

## Structured interview questions

We ask structured questions for all interviews, meaning that all candidates are asked the same questions in an effort to reduce bias and to even the playing-field. The interview [may be recorded](../tools/guide_to_using_brighthire.md) so that we can focus on the candidate, not taking notes, and ensure that we're delivering a great interview experience. If a candidate prefers not to be recorded during the interview, they can let us know—the structure of the interview and decision-making process will remain the same and the decision not to be recorded will have no weight on their candidacy.

# Universal interviews

All departments are likely to have some or all of the below universal interview stages:

## Recruiter Screen

- Interviewer: the assigned recruiter for the role.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Details: the goal of the recruiter screen is to learn more about your background and interest in Sourcegraph. In addition to learning about you, the recruiter will also tell you about Sourcegraph, the role, compensation/benefits, the interview process, and answer any questions you have.
- Example questions:
  - Tell me about your work experience, past to present.
  - Why are you looking for something new?
  - Why are you interested in Sourcegraph and our open position?
  - What are you looking for in your next role, and what are your career goals?
  - Do you have overlap with a specific time zone? (only applicable for roles that have time zone requirements)
  - Tell us how much exposure, if any, you have had working with teammates across time zones. How did you stay connected and up-to-date with your team?
  - What is your ideal start date?
  - Are your compensation expectations in line with our compensation range, which is XYZ?
  - What questions do you have for us?

## Hiring Manager Screen

- Interviewer: the hiring manager.
- Duration: 30-minutes is average, but sometimes these are longer.
- Details: during this stage in the interview process, the Hiring Manager will introduce themself, get to know you, and answer any initial questions you may have. This stage is meant to be conversational and informative for both us and the candidate.
- Example questions:
  - What did you do to prepare for this conversation?
  - Why do you want to be a [role title]? What are your long term goals?
  - How would you explain what Sourcegraph does to a friend?

## Networking Meeting

- Interviewer(s): Any Sourcegraph teammate that the candidate would benefit from meeting with.
- Duration: 30-minutes on average.
- Details: the networking meeting is an optional step in the interview process designed to introduce passive candidates to Sourcegraph. A passive candidate is someone who is not actively seeking new job opportunities but may be open to casually meet with teammates to learn more about the company. During the meeting, introduce yourself and provide an overview of Sourcegraph's product, mission, culture, and values. Ask the candidate about their background, experience, and career aspirations. Listen intently and try to genuinely tie back why the open roles at Sourcegraph would be meaningful to the candidate and their career. Ultimately, the goal of the networking meeting is to establish a relationship with the candidate and answer any questions they have.

## Resume Deep Dive

- Interviewer(s): the hiring manager or a peer leads the Resume deep dive, and sometimes there is another teammate who shadows the interview.
- Duration: 60-minutes.
- Details: a resume deep dive (often referred to as a "Topgrade Interview") is an interview style where we take a deep dive into a candidate's background, past to present. The goal of a resume deep dive is to uncover the motivation behind a candidate's decision making, as well as their strengths, weaknesses, and accomplishments in past roles. [Here](https://www.lever.co/blog/topgrading-interview-guide/) is a document to help guide expectations on this stage in the interview process. This is simply an example of what to expect, and does not represent the questions we will be asking.
- Example questions:
  - How did you find your job? Why did you choose to accept it?
  - Who hired you? What was their name? What did they hire you to do?
  - Why would your former boss say were your strengths and opportunities for growth?
  - What did you like most and least about your job?
  - What would your peers say about you?
  - What are you most proud of accomplishing while in your job?
  - Why did you leave?

## Peer Interview

- Interviewer(s): the other members of the team for which you're interviewing.
- Duration: 30–45 minutes.
- Details: during the peer interview, your potential future colleagues will assess if you will be a value-add to the team, take and give constructive criticism, and be an overall supportive team member. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions directed to your potential future peers.
- Example questions:
  - Tell us about the best team you've ever been a part of.
  - Tell us about a time when you had to put your team's interests above your own.

## Cross-functional Team Collaboration Interview

- Interviewer(s): people outside of your respective department who you would cross-collaborate with regularly.
- Duration: 30–60 minutes.
- Details: during this stage of the interview process, you will meet with members of another team with whom you would partner regularly. The goal of this interview is to understand how you communicate and collaborate with cross-functional partners within Sourcegraph.
- Example questions:
  - Tell us about a recent project you worked on where you collaborate with people outside of your department
  - Tell me about a project where you or your team had a disagreement with someone in another function

## Leadership Interview

- Interviewer: a member of the leadership team for the department.
- Duration: 30–45 minutes.
- Details: during this stage in the interview process, a member of the leadership team for the department will ask questions to gain more insight into the following areas: your grit, curiosity, passion, growth mindset, intelligence, and values. They will also answer any final questions you may have! This is generally the last stage in our interview process.
- Leadership interviews tend to vary by department, role, and leader. Your recruiter will prepare you and answer any questions you may have prior to the interview.

## Values Interview

Read more about our values interview [here](evaluating_values.md).

- Interviewers: two teammates outside of the department for which you're interviewing.
- Duration: 30-minutes.
- Details: this interview is focused entirely on our values and how a candidate's views and experiences align with them. Our values are key to our success as individuals and as a company. You can read more about them [here](../../../../company-info-and-process/values/index.md).
- Example questions: We will ask behavioral-based, open-ended questions directly related to our values.
  -Tell us about a time when you advocated for someone else
  -Tell us about a project you are most proud of completing

# Department specific interviews

In addition to the above interviews, some departments have department-specific interviews.

## Administrative

#### Executive Business Partner working session scenario

- Interviewer(s) Greg Bastis, VP of Sales
- Duration: 60-minutes.
- Details: The goal of this working session is to give us all a sense of what it would be like to work together. Below is a hypothetical situation that we would like to play out during this 60-minute session.

  You are new to the role (30 days) when Greg asks you to meet and discuss organizing an in-person event for the sales/marketing teams. The idea behind this event is to build strong relationships among team members and align on goals.

  Your objective in this meeting is to:

1.  Gather all the information that you need in order to be successful at planning and executing this event.
2.  Provide recommendations, share potential ideas, and discuss solutions with Greg.

Our advice:

- Don't go overboard on preparation or detail.
- Clever ideas are awesome and appreciated.
- We are also looking for your process/framework/principles.
- If you need to take notes, we usually use Google Docs!

Some background info:

- Team org: [Sales team](../../../sales/index.md) and [Marketing team](../../../marketing/index.md)
- [Publicly referenceable customer logos](https://about.sourcegraph.com/customers/)
- Everything at [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/) and our [handbook](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com) should be assumed to be accurate and up to date.

A few pointers:

- Ask identifying questions about existing gaps on the team
- Be ready to identify immediate solutions
- Be prepared to have a dynamic conversation to uncover nuances about the teams you will be working with

## BizOps, Finance, Legal, TechOps

### BizOps: Director of Data & Analytics take-home project

- It’s 2021, and Sourcegraph is growing at a rapid pace. With the launch of Sourcegraph cloud and significant growth in sales of the existing self-hosted deployment option, the VP of Operations is asking you to prepare a plan for upgrading our data infrastructure to be prepared for the next several years of growth.
- We have a complex user journey that can touch a number of websites, apps, and integrations:
  - Data sources:
    - Websites
      - About.sourcegraph.com: Sourcegraph’s marketing website (pages include: a splash homepage, our blog, about us, contact us, press, careers, terms of service, etc.)
      - Docs.sourcegraph.com (documentation)
      - Custom SEO landing pages
      - And more…
  - Core products:
    - Sourcegraph.com: The cloud product, used for searching across the universe of open source code and users’ private repositories. Can be used as an actual product destination or simply as a demo as needed.
    - Self-hosted Sourcegraph instances: Self-hosted webapps, using the same codebase as Sourcegraph.com, but deployed on-premises or in our customers’ private clouds. An example would be Uber’s private Sourcegraph instance—only accessible to Uber employees and contractors, and only containing Uber’s code. It would be accessible to Uber devs on an internal-only domain, like sourcegraph.uber.com.
  - Integrations:
    - Sourcegraph browser extensions: Chrome, Safari, and Firefox extensions that add Sourcegraph features to other websites where users view code (e.g. enhanced code views on sites like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and more).
    - Sourcegraph editor extensions: downloadable plugins for desktop code editors, such as VS Code, Atom, and Vim, that add some Sourcegraph features locally.
- Key notes:
  - The expectation for privacy is much higher for our downloaded products and self-hosted Sourcegraph instances. E.g. the customers who opt to host Sourcegraph themselves expect us not to track their users’ actions. Instead, we only collect aggregated telemetry from self-hosted Sourcegraph instances, with no individual user-level details.
  - Consumers of this user journey data include nearly every part of the company, from product (core app engagement and product usage data), engineering (application performance data), marketing and sales (top of funnel data and user engagement data for outreach), customer success (customer health and engagement), and more.
  - Our current traffic is ~100k monthly website visitors and cloud product users and ~40k monthly self-hosted instance users.
- Deliverables:
  - Please design a high-level, conceptual data pipeline that would serve our business’s needs. Please name specific recommended tools (or options) to serve at each step of the pipeline. No need to write descriptions of every step, but please be prepared to answer questions about them.
  - Please describe the basic structure of data at the beginning(s) and the end(s) of the pipeline, and be prepared to discuss the data transformations that take place along the way.
  - Finally, please draw or describe (no real data required) the dashboards or reports that you would recommend providing to the CEO, the head of Product, and the head of Marketing each month.
- We recommend that you spend approximately 2 hours on this case study. Please feel free to reach out with any questions!

### BizOps: Product Analyst take-home project

This exercise should take 2–3 hours to complete; please don’t take more than that!

- Getting setup: You’ll be using Mode Analytics public datasets to complete this take-home project. Here are the steps to getting into the SQL workspace:
  _ 1.Create an account if you don’t already have one
  _ 2.Click the green+in the top right (‘Create report’)to access the workspace \* 3.We’ll be using the following Mode Public Warehousetables to complete the exercise:tutorials.playbook_users,tutorials.playbook_events,tutorials.playbook_experiments,tutorials.playbook_emails
- Prompt: For each of the following questions please create charts and/or tables (within Mode or by exporting to a spreadsheet tool if that’s easier) to show your findings. We’re not expecting a slide deck or document to explain your findings, but quick summaries of charts, if needed, are just fine. Keep in mind that in most cases there are no “right” or “wrong” answers; we’re more interested in your approach and thought processes.
  _ 1. What company is most engaged with the product?
  _ 2. We ran an A/B test (experiment) to increase ‘like_message’ actions users are taking. Which variant would you recommend going forward with, if any?
- When you’ve completed the project, share your results via static run links along with some availability you have over the next week to review the project with a BizOps team member. When reviewing, you can expect questions about your approach in getting to know the data, the process you took to find the results, results themselves, and how you decided to communicate your findings.

### Legal: Corporate & Legal Counsel take-home project

The goal of the assignment is to give you a chance to demonstrate how you think, write, and negotiate while tackling issues that are top of mind for Sourcegraph and our customers.

- Please see the attached MSA redlines (we will provide this to you if you get to this stage in the process) from our prospective customer, a CA-based tech company. Deal summary:
  - On-premise instance
  - 100K USD ACV
- Will you respond to the redlines and include comments to the customer explaining your reasoning for any redlines that you reject or modify? Please accept any redlines that you suggest that we agree to with a brief comment explaining why.
- In addition, please draft a short, casual note with your assessment that you would send to the account executive. Include a short issues list, with the prioritization of issues made clear.

### TechOps: Tech Ops IT Engineer take-home project / Technical Interview

The technical interview should be approximately:

- 25 min for questions from Nicky and Dan M
- 10 min questions from you to us
- 10 min to discuss a short take-home project (3 min presentation and 7 min discussion)

Project:

- We have a fully remote team. Tech Ops wants to ensure that our Team Members are appropriately protected from security threats. As part of the onboarding process we want to provide all new hires with a Security Checklist. What would you put on this checklist?

It is important that 10 minutes be left at the end for feedback. Visual aids are recommended, but not required, to help keep the conversation on track.

**Interview Prompts**

A summary of the 4 prompts are provided below:

1. **Champion Building:** A key part of the Technical Advisor (Customer Success) role is identifying, building, and nurturing champions. What types of strategies have you, or would you, employ to build and nurture champions? What would you do - what actions would you take - if your existing champion left? How would you strategize with your AE to nurture your champion relationships; what would you expect your AE to do vs what would you do? Please provide practical examples of how you have built champions like this in the past.
2. **Account Corrective Actions:** While we intend to be as proactive as possible, monitoring and inspecting accounts is a reality of our role. What would your approach be to various kinds of corrective actions that you identify? For example, what if use has declined over the past 3 months? What if our points of contact no longer want to talk or meet with us on a regular basis? What if you’re seeing that your customer has had an influx of support tickets? Please provide practical examples of times when you have been able to put these strategies into action.
3. **QBRs**: As the team responsible for ensuring we’re delivering value and positive outcomes to our customers we expect to utilize regular business reviews with our champion stakeholders. Talk us through your expected agenda and what other internal stakeholders from Sourcegraph might you want to include in these, and why. Please provide practical examples of how your QBR's have gone in the past.
4. **Identifying Expansion Opportunities:** A significant part of responsibility for this role will be identifying expansion opportunities based on uncovering new needs within our existing customers. What strategies would you employ personally to uncover and identify potential opportunity areas where we can solve new and additional problems for our customers? When thinking about qualifying a lead or opportunities what criteria would you personally use to assess the potential? Please provide practical examples of times you have been able to identify these situations that led to a successful customer expansion.

## Customer Engineering (Leadership)

### Hiring Manager Screen

During this stage of the interview, you will meet with the hiring manager. During this conversation they'll seek to understand both your exposure to a technical product and audiences and how you lead in a fast-growth organization.

### Cross-Functional Peer Collaboration

You'll meet with a potential peer in an adjacent team with whom we want to understand how you build relationships and partner with other leaders and how you manage across adjacent teams.

### Leadership & Team Management with 2 IC CEs

You'll meet with two individual contributors on the CE team to learn about how you build relationships within a team and how you lead, mentor, and develop others.

### Customer Engineering Leadership Working Session

For this interview round, you will have a 45-min long working session with the Customer Engineering leadership team. This working session is intended to give us a sense of what it’d be like to work together and help us understand what impact you’d make on the organization right away and get a sense of what new ideas you have for improving our team. The format of this working session is very laid back; bring any notes, prepared talking points, or visual cues that you feel are useful, and be prepared to discuss your ideas with interviewers. Of course feel free to ask questions during the session, too! Plan to spend roughly 30 minutes on the topic in an open, collaborative manner, and leave 15 minutes at the end for you to ask questions of the team.

**Topic: your near-term impact and priorities to elevate the CE team**

Hopefully by this point, you’ve learned quite a bit from the individuals you’ve talked to about the team, company, and product. Additionally, we’ve provided more information in this prompt about the CE team, sales process, org operating cadences, and current metrics. Using all of the information you’ve learned so far, we’d like you to brainstorm where you’d start and what impact you’d expect to make on the team right away. For the purpose of this exercise, assume you’re past the 30 day mark of being in-seat and you’re up-to-speed on the team.

Some questions to guide your brainstorming and the working session:

1. What are your ideas and plans for improving the team and our ability to positively impact the business and our prospective and current customers?
2. What gaps exist in our current process? What are the greatest opportunities for improvement? How might you address those?
3. What would you need from your direct peer, Gronk (CE RD EMEA), your team leads, Alex and Dan, and your cross-functional peers in Sales, Support, Post-Sales, and Engineering?

**Background information**

Below is some background information and context about the journey and current state of the team to help aid you in your preparation and proposed plan.

**CE team structure context**

In November, the organization split into dedicated pre- and post-sales, with CEs paired 1:3 with AEs based on region. Previously CEs were pre- and post-sales paired stably 1:1 with an AE. We have one individual in APAC, 4 individuals based in US-West (including 1 dual IC / team lead), 3 individuals based in US-East (including 1 dual IC / team lead), a CE RD in EMEA, and two individuals in EMEA reporting into that CE RD.

**Sourcegraph sales process context**

CEs attend any / every pre-sales call with prospective customers, as early as Stage 0 - prospecting. Often CEs will do product demos in introductory meetings, and subsequent meetings as well. A key part of our sales cycle is the trial. As the majority of our customers use our self-hosted on-premise deployment option, before a trial can begin the CE must help the customer deploy and configure an instance. Our trials typically run 30 days. During trials, CEs tend to lead 4 training sessions. Trial success is mostly measured based on user surveys.

CEs are also involved in PLG-led cloud prospects, separate from our sales-led motion. We perform outreach and nurture prospects to try and help them activate their cloud trial, answering any technical or product questions along the way. These may or may not advance as a PQL into our standard sales process.

**Organizational operating cadences**

Today, we operate on the following cadences:

- Weekly
  - Deal technical risk and status inspection ([Tech Win Mgmt ](../../../technical-success/ce/process/tech-win-process.md))
  - Sales forecast
  - Forecast debrief / roll-up
  - 1:1s
- Bi-Weekly
  - Technical Success leadership sync
  - CE regional team meetings
- Monthly
  - CE Global team meeting
- Quarterly
  - Internal Revenue QBRs
  - Quarterly Kick-offs
  - Technical Success departmental meeting

Asynchronous [team norms](../../../technical-success/ce/team-culture/working-with-customers.md)

**Current team metrics and actuals**

[Technical Closure of Trials](../../../technical-success/ce/#technical-closure-of-trials/index.md)

- Goal: 80%
- Actual: 77%

Time in Stage 4 (Trial)

### Product Marketing Manager working session

- Duration: 60-minutes.
- The goal of the working session is to give us all a sense of what it'd be like to work together and make sure we have a shared understanding of the role and goals. This is not meant to be stressful or require a lot of preparation.
- First, we'd like to cover some general stuff:
  - Your 20-second Sourcegraph pitch: Imagine a senior eng at your current company asked you what Sourcegraph is. We don't expect this to be super polished or even 100% correct - we want to hear your spin on what we're selling and the value proposition.
  - What do you need to be successful? (tools, resources/special budget for anything, specific commitments from other teams, anything from me, etc.)
- Then we'd like to hear, at a high level, how you would approach putting together a GTM plan for the [TBD Product] GA launch.
- This could easily take several hours, but we're just looking for a 60-min conversation total (including the general stuff above). _You don't need to put together a full plan!_
- Please don't go overboard on preparation, plans, or detail. Clever ideas are awesome, but we're looking for your process/framework/principles. A Google Doc outline is how we'd do this kind of thing internally, so that's best. Doesn't have to be pretty. If you prefer slides, that's fine. This will be a casual back and forth conversation; not a formal presentation.
- Feel free to reach out to Andy with any questions.

### Senior Customer Marketing Manager working session

- The goal of the working session is to give us all a sense of what it'd be like to work together and make sure we have a shared understanding of the role and goals.

  - Part 1: Driving engagement with our Customer Advisory Board members
    The first part of the meeting will be with Andy Schumeister (Director of Product Marketing), Victoria Yunger (Product Marketing Lead, Enterprise), and Alex Isken (Product Marketing Manager, Cloud).
  - First, you’ll share your 20-second Sourcegraph pitch: Imagine a senior eng at your current company asked you what Sourcegraph is. We don't expect this to be super polished or even 100% correct - we want to hear your spin on what we're selling and the value proposition.
  - Then, we’d like to hear your ideas for how we can drive engagement with our Customer Advisory Board members in-between meetings in order to provide even more value for members.
  - Please don't go overboard on preparation, plans, or detail. Clever ideas are awesome, but we're also looking for your process/framework/principles. A Google Doc outline is how we'd do this kind of thing internally, so that's best. Doesn't have to be pretty. If you prefer slides, that's fine. This will be a casual back and forth conversation; not a formal presentation. You’ll also have an opportunity to ask the team questions during this portion.

  - Part 2: Setting you up for success
  - Then, you’ll meet 1:1 with Andy where you’ll have a chance to discuss the role and share what you need to be successful: tools, resources/special budget for anything, specific commitments from other teams, anything from Andy, etc.)

### Manager of Internal Communications working session

- Duration: 60-minutes.
- The goal of the working session is to give us all a sense of what it'd be like to work together and make sure we have a shared understanding of the role and goals. This is not meant to be stressful or require a lot of preparation.
- First, we'd like to cover some general stuff:
  - Your 20-second Sourcegraph pitch: Imagine a senior eng at your current company asked you what Sourcegraph is. We don't expect this to be super polished or even 100% correct - we want to hear your spin on what we're selling and the value proposition.
  - What do you need to be successful? (tools, resources/special budget for anything, specific commitments from other teams, anything from me, etc.)
- Then we'd like to hear, at a high level, how you would approach putting together Sourcegraph’s 60–90 minute Q1 kickoff this February.
- Q1 company kickoff
- This of course takes hours of planning, but we’re just looking for a 60 minute conversation total (including the general stuff above). _You don't need to put together a full plan!_
- Some (hypothetical) updates to account for:
  - We missed our Q4 revenue target and are slightly under for the fiscal year, but current pipeline has us on track to hit Q1 goals
  - We’re updating the company travel policy from one individual trip per year anywhere in the world to collaborate with a coworker, to a regional meetup trip (west coast NA, east coast NA, EMEA)
- Please don't go overboard on preparation, plans, or detail. Clever ideas are awesome, but we're looking for your process/framework/principles. A Google Doc outline is how we'd start off content planning. Doesn't have to be pretty. If you prefer slides, that's fine. This will be a casual back and forth conversation; not a formal presentation.
- Feel free to reach out to Amie (amie.rotherham@sourcegraph.com) with any questions.

## People Operations

### Senior People Partner working session

- Duration: 60-minutes.
- Our working session is designed to give us more insight into how you'd think about and approach typical scenarios you might be called on to provide support to managers on. We've detailed three scenarios for you to walk us through the way you'd think and respond to each scenario. For each scenario please walk us through:
  - How would you approach this situation and why? What risks or concerns does each scenario present?
  - Who would you involve, why and how?
  - What feedback would you give the manager concerned?
  - What, if anything, might be changed internally based on this situation arising?
- We will provide the detailed scenarios via email 24 hours before your scheduled interview.
- Note: you don't need to submit anything (in writing or presentation) ahead of the interview - just structure your thoughts and talk us through it! We'll ask questions as they come up.

### Senior People Operations Generalist working session

**Working Session Agenda (45m):**

- Prompt 1 (15m)
- Prompt 2 (15m)
- Q&A (15m)

**Purpose of this exercise**

As our new Senior People Ops Generalist, you will be building processes and programs, and supporting our business objectives through key people initiatives. Our culture is built on transparency, and our [handbook](../../../../index.md) is the pilar to providing all teammates access to the who, what, why, and how as it relates to People resources and processes. We want you to poke holes in our handbook and help us make it better (because we know we still have room to grow and improve!)

**Prompt 1:**

1. Choose one of the following handbook pages to review: [Impact Reviews ](../../people-ops/process/teammate-sentiment/impact-reviews/index.md) **_or_** [Onboarding](../../../../company-info-and-process/onboarding/index.md)
2. Come up with ideas on how you would improve this page and/or process for our teammates. _Things to consider:_
   1. Does the content set clear expectations on what to expect?
   2. Have we accounted for common questions teammates may have? If not, what’s missing? Is the answer located elsewhere in the handbook?
   3. What could be better from a process perspective?
   4. What people data or analytics would you incorporate as part of your recommendation to improve this process?
3. **Deliverable:** Put together a brief sample of content (4-5 sentences) that relates to _one_ of the improvements you would suggest and add to this handbook page on day 1! (Please send this via email prior to the live working session)
4. **Working Session:** During the live working session, we expect you to share your feedback and recommendations in any format that you chose. This is a collaborative exercise where you can come in with your perspectives and any questions you have for us regarding the handbook page you chose!

**Prompt 2:**

1. Review the [Resources for Teammates Section](../../index.md#resources-for-teammates) in the handbook. (you can consider this the source of truth for all resources the people team has compiled to best support our teammates)
2. During the working session, we expect you to provide us with your feedback on how it could be better.
   _Things to consider:_
   1. Are you able to easily find an answer to common ‘people’ related questions? If not, what’s missing?
   2. Is there a “coming soon” section or missing HR pillar that you would prioritize adding to the handbook?
3. **Deliverable:** If you had the ability to re-organize this section in any way you wanted, what would your ideal Table of Contents look like? Share your idea with us in any format you chose prior to the working session!
4. **Working Session:** During the live working session, we expect you to walk us through why you chose the structure that you did and also share your overall feedback on how to improve our “source of truth”.

## Product

### Product Manager

#### Async writing project

- Interviewer(s): NA—this is a take home assignment. [Two members from the Product team](../../../engineering/product/index.md) will review your PR-FAQ and discuss it with you in the next round of interviews.
- Duration: ~1 hour
- Details: This is a take home writing assignment to see how you communicate and think about product problems.

**What we want to measure**

Will the candidate be successful in our all-remote environment in which the majority of communication happens in written form (Slack messages, GitHub issues, pull request and commit messages).

- Is the candidate able to see and communicate the big picture in an inspiring way?
- Does the PR-FAQ communicate the product vision and explain why this is an important problem to solve?
- Does the PR-FAQ have clear writing with correct spelling and grammar? That means: short and non-convoluted sentences, simple words instead of jargon when possible, no mixture of past and present tense, etc.
- Does it demonstrate empathy with the reader and anticipate what the reader might not know?

Key competencies:

- Communication
- Strategic thinking/visioning

Note that this exercise is intended more to result in an early-stage PR-FAQ that focuses primarily on communicating the product vision and why it's an important problem to solve. Should the candidate move forward to the followup product call, the focus will be on what collaboration would look like, how they would talk about the PR-FAQ, and how they'd work through getting it implemented.

**Prompt**

Candidates are sent the following prompt after they pass the intro call:

We are excited to move you to the next step in the interview process! The next step of our interview process is to have you complete a take home writing exercise.

Please write a PR-FAQ in a Google Doc for a Sourcegraph AI coding assistant powered by large language models (LLMs).

It should include:

- A press release section
- A success criteria section that defines what success looks like for this project
- A FAQ section that includes:
  - Answers to these 3 pre-defined questions:
  - What's the MVP of this project?
  - What metrics would you measure?
  - How can this feature differentiate from GitHub Copilot?
- And the top 3 questions you think are the most important for the project (and answers)

We expect this to take you ~1 hour. What’s important is that the writing is clear and easy to understand. It should show us that you care about your writing by making conscious decisions of what to leave in or out, paying attention to grammar and spelling, and phrasing things in an understandable way.

Please send link to your Google doc using the link below when you are finished.
