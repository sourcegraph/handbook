# Recruitment Branding

Join us in sharing about [Life at Sourcegraph](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sourcegraph/life/lifeatsourcegraph/?viewAsMember=true)! An important part of finding top notch talent is leveraging our individual networks and sharing about Sourcegraph's [Culture](../../resources_for_candidates.md#sourcegraphs-culture) and [Values](../../../../company-info-and-process/values/index.md).
This page outlines recruitment branding tips and information to tell the story of what it's like to [work at Sourcegraph](../../resources_for_candidates.md#working-at-sourcegraph).

We post about hiring initiatives and Sourcegraph culture content on our company [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sourcegraph/?viewAsMember=true), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sourcegraph?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/sourcegraph), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/sourcegraph), and [Blog](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/?_ga=2.123203275.1380659926.1640620768-539125958.1632800152) pages.

## Job boards

Our [Careers Page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/jobs/?_ga=2.236774849.1380659926.1640620768-539125958.1632800152) is a great resource for candidates to learn about working at Sourcegraph and view our current job opportunities. In addition to the Careers page, we also leverage Job Boards to post about our open roles.

### Before posting to a job board:

In order to assess the return on investment for any given job board, it is critical that we create custom sources and tracking links in Greenhouse. This will allow us to capture data on where applicants are applying from. To do this, please follow these instructions:

- Step 1: Send a Slack message to #hiring outlining the job board(s) you would like to post to and the job(s) you would like to see posted.

- Step 2: A talent team member will 1) [create a custom source](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200721664-Add-Custom-Source) in Greenhouse for that job board and 2) [create a tracking link for a single job post](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405093302427-Create-a-tracking-link-for-a-single-job-post) and/or [create a tracking link for the entire job board](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/201823760-Create-Tracking-Link-for-Job-Board).

- Step 3: The talent team member will provide the tracking links in the thread and help you post the jobs!

### We currently cross-post our open positions to the following locations:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=sourcegraph). All jobs that are publically listed in our applicant tracking system are automatically pushed to LinkedIn.
- ["Ask HN: Who is Hiring" monthly thread](hacker-news-who-is-hiring.md). Devon Coords posts one job to Hacker News on the first of every month.
- [RemoteWoman](https://remotewoman.com/). RemoteWoman scrapes our career page, we can also message them to manually post our unlisted roles.
- [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/). With our current plan we can post up to 10 roles at a time (and can rotate out roles as they are filled). Devon Coords owns this list and payments are made with Nick's Brex. We can update our posted roles anytime by emailing jobpostings@hiretechladies.com.
- [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Sourcegraph-EI_IE1356770.11,22.htm) All jobs that are publically listed in our applicant tracking system are automatically pushed to Glassdoor.
