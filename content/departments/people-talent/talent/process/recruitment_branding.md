In addition to posting our open roles on our Careers page and LinkedIn profile, we also leverage various job boards.

### Before posting to a job board:

In order to assess the return on investment for any given job board, it is critical that we create custom sources and tracking links in Greenhouse. This will allow us to capture data on where applicants are applying from.

Please follow these instructions:

- Step 1: Send a Slack message to #hiring outlining the job board(s) you would like to post to and the job(s) you would like to see posted.

- Step 2: A talent team member will 1) [create a custom source](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200721664-Add-Custom-Source) in Greenhouse for that job board and 2) [create a tracking link for a single job post](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405093302427-Create-a-tracking-link-for-a-single-job-post) and/or [create a tracking link for the entire job board](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/201823760-Create-Tracking-Link-for-Job-Board).

- Step 3: The talent team member will provide the tracking links in the thread and help you post the roles!
