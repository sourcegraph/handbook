#### LinkedIn We're Hiring & Employee Spotlights

Each month we share a [We’re hiring](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7077670681450024961/) or [Employee Spotlight](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7074874160249737216/) on the company LinkedIn page, alternating between the two. The content is collected and posted by the Recruiting Operations team on the 2nd Wednesday of every month.

- New Hire Spotlights feature new teammates. The question template and previous responses can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d8SuwX9oh4NJlPl0V6_mqnlDjhq8jylj).
- Teammate Spotlights feature a current teammate, ideally in a role that we are currently hiring for. This helps us to attract potential candidates. The question template and previous responses can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l41Uuz8iC32v_2zY-Xc73L8eKkqS-5hA).

The Recruiting Operations team follows the following instructions to use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Wihuiao8IQ0OatMz4r2A5f/Fy24-Social-media-templates?type=design&node-id=1331-2529&mode=design&t=rv9jjhi4EqcmfUIp-0) to create the banners for the posts:

1. First, duplicate photo we want to use by clicking the title of the photo, then click command “d”
2. Double click the text to edit
3. To update the employee photo, click on the photo, go to “image” on right toolbar, fill image, upload image of teammate’s choosing
   1. If format gets messed up, click custom, then click “fit”
4. Export image for LinkedIn:
   1. For normal: scroll down on right, export 2x, PNG, resolution high
   2. For compressed: figma logo top left, plugins, export compressed PDF, 2x, resolution high, PNG

In addition to posting our open roles on our Careers page and LinkedIn profile, we also leverage various job boards.

### Before posting to a job board:

In order to assess the return on investment for any given job board, it is critical that we create custom sources and tracking links in Greenhouse. This will allow us to capture data on where applicants are applying from.

Please follow these instructions:

- Step 1: Send a Slack message to [#ask-hiring](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=ask-hiring) outlining the job board(s) you would like to post to and the job(s) you would like to see posted.

- Step 2: A talent team member will 1) [create a custom source](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/200721664-Add-Custom-Source) in Greenhouse for that job board and 2) [create a tracking link for a single job post](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405093302427-Create-a-tracking-link-for-a-single-job-post) and/or [create a tracking link for the entire job board](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/201823760-Create-Tracking-Link-for-Job-Board).

- Step 3: The talent team member will provide the tracking links in the thread and help you post the roles!
