# Reference checks

Reference checks are an important part of our process. Ultimately, the goal behind our reference checks is to ensure that we are setting up the new hire for success and know how to best work with them. Reference checks must be completed prior to an offer being extended.

We conduct two reference checks. Requested references will typically be a former manager(s) and/or colleague(s) and may be from the candidate’s most recent or previous companies. We will never conduct a reference call without explicit consent from the candidate.

The Talent Team is responsible for conducting reference checks and sharing the results with the Hiring Manager. Reference checks can be conducted directly by the Hiring Manager if requested.

## **Process:**

- Once the interview process reaches the "Final Interview" stage, the Recruiting Operations Specialist will send the Reference Check Information form through Greenhouse.
  - When the candidate fills out the form, their references' contact information will automatically be submitted to Greenhouse.
- Once references are received, the Recruiter will send an email to schedule a reference check.
  - Note: Verbal references are preferred, however if time doesn’t permit, written references are also acceptable.
- Recruiter will take notes using the [reference check template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1isACchClWxT98gKv9gXdjptCaEdnVgYvHDcoIuK4QoY/edit).
- Once complete, the Recruiter will add the reference check responses as an attachment under the candidate's "details" tab in Greenhouse.
- Recruiter will then share the results with the Hiring Manager using the Slack template.
- Once positive references are confirmed and approved by the Hiring Manager, the Recruiter will proceed as normal to the [offer stage](extending_an_offer.md#offer-stage)

### Email template for references

Hello `reference name`!

`candidate name` provided your name as a professional reference, and I was hoping you would be open to telling me a bit about your experience working with them. For context, we are considering `candidate name` for a `role title` here at Sourcegraph, and are looking for someone who `insert what we're looking for in this person`.

I would like to schedule a time for us to have a chat in the next 1-2 days. The conversation shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes. What time would be convenient for you?

If your schedule doesn’t allow for a call, would you mind responding to this email with brief answers to the below questions?

Thanks so much in advance for taking the time! It’s greatly appreciated.

Here are the questions we will cover:

- How long did you work with them?
- In what capacity did you work together?
- `if manager` Did they have any direct reports?
- What were their core responsibilities?
- What were their biggest strengths they brought to the role, or to the company as a whole?
- What were some things they could have improved upon?
- Did you speak to them about this? (If yes: did they show improvements?)
- Can you think of an instance when they went above and beyond?
- If given the opportunity, would you work with them again?

Thank you again for taking the time to help us out with doing this reference.

Best,

`Recruiter name`
