> Our mission at Sourcegraph is to make it so that everyone can code. Software has driven a lot of technological innovation, and yet today, only a small fraction of the world can contribute to this progress by writing code. We believe that enabling more people to code will create economic opportunity across the world and will drive better and faster technological progress that benefits everyone.
>
> The problem developers face today is that the amount, complexity, and value of code is increasing quickly, and it is hard to keep up. We call this problem Big Code.
> Sourcegraph helps developers at our customers and in open source, find code, understand code, and automate changes to that code at scale in massive codebases.
>
> It’s an exciting time to join because our business is growing rapidly (4x revenue growth last year with zero customer churn) and our $50m Series C from Sequoia has given us the opportunity to make these big ambitious bets while being fiscally responsible.
