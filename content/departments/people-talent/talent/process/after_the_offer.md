## Onboarding process for US-based teammates & contractors

After the candidate formally signs the offer letter via DocuSign, the Recruiter takes the following steps to onboard the new teammate:

**Step 1**: Via Greenhouse, the Recruiter sends a welcome email to the candidate by selecting the `"welcome email from recruiter - US"` or the `"welcome email from recruiter - Non-US"`template, depending on the location of the new Teammate.

- To: the Candidate
- CC: Recruiting@sourcegraph.com, Onboarding@sourcegraph.com, Hiring Manager
- This should be sent within 24-hours of acceptance.

**Step 2**: The Recruiter confirms that the job open, start and hired dates are correct, ensuring accurate time-to-fill data. They should also ensure that the candidate application date is accurate, which can be skewed if transfering candidates to another req in Greenhouse.

- To view/edit job information in Greenhouse, click 'Job Setup' and then 'Job Info'. This will show you the role details and you can confirm that all of the information is correct.
- **Important note:** When transfering a candidate from one req to another, please ensure that their application date reflects the date that they applied for the original req. You will need to manually do this on the new req by clicking the pencil icon next to "Applied on":

**Step 3**: The Recruiter confirms the candidate source information is accurate, ensuring accurate source data.

- To view/edit source information, click the 'Details' tab on the candidate's Greenhouse profile and scroll down to the 'Source and Responsibility' section. Confirm that the Source, Recruiter, and Coordinator are correct and if needed, edit the information by clicking the pencil button beside each field.

**Step 4**: The Recruiter confirms that the candidate's profile name in Greenhouse matches their legal first & last name, which can be found on the signature page of their signed offer letter.

**Step 5**: The Recruiter declines all other candidates if we are closing the role / not hiring for multiple positions.

- If hiring for multiple positions:
  - Do not hire multiple people under the same job req in Greenhouse.
  - You must open a new job in Greenhouse and transfer the candidate's profile and scorecards over.

**Step 6**: The Recruiter marks the candidate as "hired" in Greenhouse.

- Click the "Mark candidate as hired" button found in the "offer details" section of the candidate's profile
- Select Close Reason: "hire-new headcount" or "hire-backfill"
- Click either `"Yes"` or `"No"` in the "Keep Job Open" section. Only keep the job open if we are hiring for multiple openings
- Select `"Yes"` for "Make Candidate Private"
- Select `"Yes"` for "Export to BambooHR
  - If you don't see an option to export to Bamboo, please ensure your Bamboo integration is active by following [these steps](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/201177624-BambooHR)
- Email a summary of this candidate to:
  - Onboarding Email
  - VP of People & Talent

  - Hiring Manager

**Step 7**: The Recruiter sends a "thank you for participating in the interview process" note to the interview team in the role-specific Slack channel

**Step 8**: The Recruiter archives the channel after people respond

**Step 9**: The Recruiter asks the Hiring Manager to make a announcement of the candidate's acceptance in the Slack #announce-teammate-hires channel.

## Changing a new hire's start date

If a new hire needs to change their start date, the Recruiter follows the below steps:

**Step 1**: Send the below Slack to Kemper & Carly in the #onboarding-internal Slack channel to request approval to change the start date.

- **Please note:** All requests must be at least 5-days before the new start date to allow enough time for People Ops to onboard.

"Hi team, we have a candidate who would like to move their start date. Please find their updated details below. Do we have the green light to make the change? If so, I will update the hire date in Greenhouse and will send an email with the updated start date.

- Name: \_\_\_\_
- Original start date: **\_\_**
- New start date: (must be a cohort date): **\_\_**"

**Step 2**: Update new start date in Greenhouse (in the offer section).

**Step 3**: Send email to candidate (reply all to the `"welcome email from recruiter"`) confirming their new start date.

## Actioning a Revoked Offer

If a new hire decides not to join us _after being marked as Hired in Greenhouse_ but _before their start date_, these are the steps to follow.

**Step 1:** The Recruiter will inform the following people that the new hire will no longer be joining Sourcegraph and provide any information/reasoning as to why the new hire made this decision:

- The Hiring Manager via a direct Slack message
- The People Ops team via the #people-talent-private-channel

**Step 2:** The Recruiter will also inform the Tech Ops team that the new hire is no longer joining the team and confirm whether the laptop has been ordered and shipped already via the #it-tech-ops slack channel.

- If the laptop has been shipped, the Tech Ops team will own the laptop retrieval process.
- If the laptop has not been shipped, no action is needed from the Recruiter.

**Step 3:** The Recruiter will discuss next steps with the Hiring Manager.

- Were there other finalists the team was excited about that they would like to extend the offer to now?
- Were there any other candidates in-process that we’d like to loop back in to complete interviews?
- If not, the Recruiter will begin sourcing and recruiting to rebuild the pipeline.

**Step 4:** The Recruiter will [re-open the role in Greenhouse](https://support.greenhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/360025208872-Re-open-job#:~:text=Expand%20the%20Filter%20panel%20and,now%20reopened%20as%20a%20Draft.).

- Use the “Unhire” function on the candidate profile.
- After the candidate has been unhired, action the candidate out of the pipeline. Mark as “Withdrew” and add notes explaining why.
- Re-open the req. in GH by searching for the req using the “Closed” job filter, then selecting “Open as Draft” and request approval.

**Step 5:** If the hiring team wants to rebuild the pipeline and accept new applicants, make sure the role is posted to our [Careers Page](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sourcegraph91?gh_src=c685479c4us) and begin recruiting as normal.

- Do not create a new requisition number for the role that needs to be refilled.

- If extending the offer to a different finalist instead of accepting new applications, there is no need to make the role visible on our job board. Simply connect with the candidate to confirm they’re still interested in the role and excited to potentially join Sourcegraph, and schedule any other necessary conversations with the hiring manager/team (optional). Then, create a new offer for approval.
  - Follow [Extending an Offer](./extending_an_offer.md) steps as normal from here.
