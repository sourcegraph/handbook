# Common interview scenarios and escalation process

## Cancellations

**Teammate or Hiring Manager**

If you cannot attend the scheduled interview, please let the Talent team know as soon as possible. Please post in [#ask-hiring](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=ask-hiring) and tag the relevant [Recruiter and Recruiting Coordinator](../../teamalignment.md) and cross-post in that role's Slack channel so the whole team has visibility.

**Candidate**

If the candidate cannot attend the scheduled interview, the Recruiting Coordinator will cancel the interview and reschedule.

## No Shows

If the candidate does not show up to the scheduled interview, please let the Talent team know as soon as possible. Please post in [#ask-hiring](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=ask-hiring) and tag the relevant [Recruiter and Recruiting Coordinator](../../teamalignment.md) and cross-post in that role's Slack channel so the whole team has visibility.

## Scheduling concerns

Ideally, each values interview will include two teammates. However, there may be circumstances where only one teammate is scheduled to participate in an interview. In that scenario, the teammate who is participating in the interview asks all interview questions.

If you have any scheduling concerns, please Slack the [Recruiter and Recruiting Coordinator](../../teamalignment.md) in the role's Slack channel.
