Talent Team Onboarding

# Onboarding

Welcome to Sourcegraph - we're VERY excited to have you on the Talent team! This page describes the onboarding philosophy and process for new talent team members as they onboard, as well as what success looks like [30 / 60 / 90](#30-60-90-day-plan) days in.

## Company-wide and Talent-specific Onboarding

Our goal is to have all talent team members fully ramped by the end of your 4th week. During your first 4 weeks, you will complete a variety of activities intended to both introduce you to the company as a whole, as well as provide you with the knowledge, tools, and support necessary to be set up for success.

### Onboarding Tooling

As a company, we use [Process.st](https://app.process.st/reports/) to guide each individuals' onboarding. Your own custom onboarding plan will be provided to you prior to your first day and will serve as your guide.

### Onboarding Support

Each new Talent team member is paired with two individuals during their onboarding time. Both of these assignments will be indicated in your Process.st checklist.

- An [onboarding buddy](../../../company-info-and-process/onboarding/buddy-program.md): your onboarding buddy is assigned as part of our company-wide onboarding program. For the Talent team, this will be a peer from an adjacent team with whom you'll work closely.
- An onboarding mentor: your onboarding mentor will be someone from the Talent team with whom you'll have regular check-ins and will be there to help guide you.
