## New Hire Welcome Kits

Our People/Talent team uses a vendor named Telescope to fulfill our new hire welcome kit orders. The [People team](people-ops) purchases inventory in bulk based on the anticipated hiring rate and monitors/reorders the inventory as needed.

- Hoodie
- Socks

- Tumbler
- T-Shirt

### How to order a welcome kit

After the offer letter has been signed, the new hire will receive instructions via their Bamboo onboarding kit to order their new hire welcome kit. The new hire will select their sizing and provide their shipping address, then Telescope will ship the kit using the inventory our people/team has already purchased. New hires will not be responsible for any costs associated with their welcome kit. If there are any fees associated with customs, the new hire can expense the amount once they've started at Sourcegraph.

## Ordering Additional Swag

There are times that teammates will want to order custom swag for other occasions, such as a team trip or celebration. Below are things to consider and steps to take to begin the ordering process.

### Where does budget come from

The budget for additional swag (any swag besides the New Hire Kit) will be the responsibility of the team requesting the swag order. For example, if the Talent team is requesting custom hats for a team trip, this order will be paid for using the Talent team’s budget.

Individual teams will not be responsible for finding budget for company-wide swag shipments such as product release swag (for example, the 2022 Code Insights T-shirts).

If you have any questions, please reach out to the #swag channel.
