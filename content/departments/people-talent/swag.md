## New Hire Welcome Kits
Our People/Talent team uses a vendor named [Printfection](https://www.printfection.com/) to fulfill our new hire welcome kit orders. The people/talent team purchases inventory in bulk based on the anticipated hiring rate and monitors/reorders the inventory as needed.

### What is in a welcome kit? 
- Hoodie
- Socks
- Stickers
- Tumbler
- T-Shirt

### How to order a welcome kit
After the offer letter has been signed, the People team will email the new hire instructions to order their new hire welcome kit. The email will include a link to submit their order for a New Hire Welcome Kit and they’ll get to choose between the Form-fitted shirt and the Unisex shirt. **It is important for teammates to choose only one and redeem it just once, as the links can be used multiple times. Please do not share the link publicly.**

Once they click on the link that corresponds to the T-shirt type they want, the new hire will need to follow these two simple steps:
1. Choose the size for the Tshirt and hoodie

2. Enter shipping information (the address can be US or non-US)

Once these steps are completed, the new hire will get an email with delivery details and our vendor will ship the kit using the inventory our people/team has already purchased. New hires will not be responsible for any costs associated with their welcome kit. If there are any fees associated with customs, the new hire can expense the amount once they've started at Sourcegraph.

If a new hire notices there is no inventory of the item/size they want, they should flag this to their recruiter who will alert the `#ask-people-team` channel. Then, someone from the people or talent team will order more inventory. If for any reason a new hire does not receive their welcome kit, please flag this to the `#ask-people-team` channel and a new kit can be ordered.

## Ordering Additional Swag

There are times that teammates will want to order custom swag for other occasions, such as a team trip or celebration. Below are things to consider and steps to take to begin the ordering process.

### Where does budget come from
The budget for additional swag (any swag not on this list) will be the responsibility of the team requesting the swag order. For example, if the Talent team is requesting custom hats for a team trip, this order will be paid for using the Talent team’s budget.

Individual teams will not be responsible for finding budget for company-wide swag shipments such as product release swag (for example, the 2022 Code Insights T-shirts).

If you have any questions, please reach out to the `#ask-people-team` channel.
