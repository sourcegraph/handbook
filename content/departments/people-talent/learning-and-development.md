### How we measure the success of our L&D Programs

At Sourcegraph, we believe in continuously improving and tailoring our L&D resources to meet the needs of our teammates. To gauge engagement and ensure that these tools are effectively contributing to your professional growth, we measure:

- **Course Completion:** We track the number of classes teammates registered for and successfully completed. This data helps us understand your commitment to learning through the resources we offer.
- **Average Class Rating:** After each class, you will be able to provide feedback about your learning experience. Your score will help us assess the effectiveness of content and the value it provides to your professional learning.
- **Active Learners:** The total number of teammates actively participating in classes.

By measuring these key engagement metrics, we can adapt our L&D offerings, to better meet our teammate’s needs. Your participation and feedback are crucial in shaping the future of your learning experience at Sourcegraph so please share any feedback via #chat-learning or #ask-people-team.
