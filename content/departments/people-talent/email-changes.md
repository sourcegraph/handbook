## Email Changes

The Tech Ops team is responsible for creating and managing teammate emails. This page outlines our standard naming conventions, reasons teammates might request changest to their email, and how to request a change.

### Standard email naming convention
Prior to a new teammate's first day at Sourcegraph, the Tech Ops team will create their email address using this standard naming convention: _PreferredFirstName.PreferredSurname@sourcegraph.com_.

Emails are typically created on the Wednesday before a new hire's start date. This email will be used to create the new Okta user, which allows access to all of our tools/systems.

### Reasons to change an email
There are ocassionally times that a teammate needs to change their email. Typically, this happens when:
- A teammate gets married and/or changes their last name
- A teammate changes their first name
- The first or last name of a teammate is longer than average and/or has a difficult spelling
