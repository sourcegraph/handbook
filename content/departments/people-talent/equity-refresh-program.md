# Equity Refresh and Retention Program

**Why do we have an Equity Refresh Program?**

At Sourcegraph, we believe that our teammates are our most valuable asset. As part of our commitment to attracting and retaining top talent, we offer an equity refresh program that rewards teammates who meet or exceed our performance expectations.

Our equity refresh program is designed to provide ongoing incentives for top performers to stay with the company and continue to contribute to our success. We believe in Sourcegraph’s future success, and by offering annual equity grants to existing teammates, we aim to create a sense of ownership and alignment between our teammates and the company. When Sourcegraph wins, we all win.

**Eligibility**

All full-time teammates who meet or exceed our “high bar” performance expectations will be eligible for participation in the equity refresh program. We reward teammates who meet or exceed our “high bar” because we believe in recognizing and rewarding exceptional contributions. This approach helps to motivate and retain our most valuable employees, while also creating a culture of high performance.

**FY25 Impact Review Eligibility:**

To be eligible, you must meet the following criteria:

- Performance: teammates must receive an impact review rating of 1, 2 or 3 during both the 1H and 2H impact review cycles. Teammates who got a 4 or 5 Rating in either, or both, the 1H and 2H review cycles are not eligible for an equity refresh grant.
- Tenure: you must have been with the company for 8+ months to be eligible.
- Hours worked: you must work full-time.

**FY26 Impact Review Eligibility:**

To be eligible, you must meet the following criteria:

- Performance: teammates must receive an impact review rating of 1, 2 or 3 in the most recent Impact Review period. Teammates who got a 4 or 5 Rating, are not eligible for an equity refresh grant.
- Tenure: you must have been with the company for 8+ months to be eligible.
- Hours worked: you must work full-time.

**When does the equity refresh take place?**

Sourcegraph’s equity refresh program takes place annually in alignment with the 1H Impact Review cycle, which occurs in the first quarter of each fiscal year. The decision to grant equity awards annually was made to provide ongoing incentives for top performers and valued members of the team.

## **How is the equity refresh grant size determined? **

Equity grant sizes are determined based on level and performance rating, as outlined in the chart below. We believe the below grant sizes are generous and are aimed to create a long-term incentive for valued teammates to stay with the company and contribute to our growth and success.

To determine the grant size, we use the past 12-month Impact Review score average. The past 12-month average is used to account for any fluctuations in performance or level over time, and to provide a fair and consistent method for determining grant sizes. If you don’t have 12-months of performance that has been scored in Impact Review, we will default to your performance score from the 1H review cycle.

**New Scale:**

Example for IC1:

- You got a 3 in 2H FY24 (544 options)
- You got a 2 in 1H FY25 (1710 options)
- Your equity grant would therefore be: 1127 Options

**4- Year Equity Refresh Program:**

The 4-Year Refresh Program is designed to ensure the ongoing competitiveness of teammate equity compensation.

- **Frequency of Refresh: **Eligible employees will be considered for an equity compensation refresh after four years of tenure are reached and will be distributed at the teammate’s anniversary date.
- **Performance and Conduct Considerations**:
  - Eligibility for the 4-Year Equity Refresh Program is contingent upon performance (must meet or exceed performance expectations) and adherence to company policies and values.
  - Teammates with performance or conduct issues may be excluded from the program at the discretion of management.
- **Calculation Method:**
  - Refresh grant = the target Equity Grant for the teammate’s current level as outlined at the rate of the fiscal year’s equity band and guidelines.

**Vesting schedule:**

Similar to our [new hire equity vesting schedule], all equity refresh grants are subject to a 4-year vesting schedule, with a 1-year cliff.

## **When do employees receive the equity grants?**

Teammates receive their equity refresh grant in alignment with the results of their impact review that takes place in the first half of a fiscal year. In FY25, all equity refresh grants will begin vesting on Feb 1, 2024.

**How do we communicate Equity Rewards to recipients?**

Once the equity grant has been approved, the People Team will provide an equity grant letter detailing the equity grant size, value, and vesting details. The direct manager will then schedule a 1:1 conversation with the recipient to communicate the reward. All equity grants must be approved by the Department VP, VP of People, Finance, and our CEO.

The following should be expressed in the communication to the recipient:

- Explain why the teammate received the additional equity grants. Highlight the performance and attributes we want to continue to motivate.
- Explain the timing and value of the awarded equity grant.

**Monitoring and Adjustment: **

The equity refresh program will be monitored regularly to ensure that it is achieving its goals and making the intended impact on employee motivation and retention. We reserve the right to change the above % guidance at any time as the business evolves. Adjustments may be made as necessary to ensure the program remains aligned with Sourcegraph's goals.
