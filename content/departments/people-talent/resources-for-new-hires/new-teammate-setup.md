2. Make the first line your name, e.g. **John Smith** (he/him)
3. Make the second line your role, include any additional information you like on subsequent lines (socials, etc.)
4. Choose **Insert image** and then **Web Address (URL)** and enter https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3173176/115082082-2d892380-9eba-11eb-9606-6c4b9c4eb465.png then choose **Small** size after it has been entered.
5. Click the image, then click **Link** and paste https://sourcegraph.com into the **Web Address** field. Now your image links to the website!
6. Your signature should now look something like this, and clicking the Sourcegraph logo should bring you to sourcegraph.com:
7. You may wish to add another line like `What is Universal Code Search? | We're hiring!` with links to https://about.sourcegraph.com/ and https://about.sourcegraph.com/careers.

### Google Calendar

- [Add your working hours to Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/settings) so your teammates know when it is safe to add meetings to your calendar.

- Add any local [holidays](../working-at-sourcegraph/holidays.md) you observe to your calendar so people know you're not working.

- Under [Event Settings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings), change the default guest permissions to **"Modify event"** (this makes it easy for teammates to reschedule when necessary).
  - Consider enabling "Speedy meetings" to build in a 5- or 10-minute break at the end of meetings.

- **Add multiple timezones to your Calendar sidebar.** This will show two time columns. This is very useful when you work closely with people in another time zone. Go to **Settings > General > Time zone** and select the **Display secondary time zone** box. Choose the time zones you want and label them.

- Get the Zoom Add On for Google Calendar. Go to your calendar, and click the + button on the right bar. This will let you pick from different apps you can integrate into your calendar. Choose _Zoom for GSuite_ and follow the instructions. This will allow you to add a Zoom call in every calendar meeting you create or have edit permissions.
