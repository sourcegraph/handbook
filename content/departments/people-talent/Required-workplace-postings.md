# Required Workplace Postings

Sourcegraph is a fully remote company with no offices. We use this page to house all posters and posting you would normally find in an office space. There is a lot of values in teammates having access to this information.

If you ever have any questions or concerns, please reach out to the people team at [people-ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com).
