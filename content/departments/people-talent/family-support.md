**Q:Can my girlfriend/boyfriend/partner’s treatments be covered by our family support budget?**
A: If your partner is tax dependent or you are a documented domestic partnership the answer is yes. If your partner is not tax dependent and you do not have a documented domestic partner, the answer is no.

**Q: What if my spouse/domestic partner has eligible expenses to submit to Maven?**
A: The Sourcegraph teammate must submit the eligible reimbursements through the Maven wallet on behalf of their partner. The reimbursement will come through payroll and you are responsible for returning the reimbursement amount amongst yourselves. `

**Q: If I’ve used a portion of your budget in the past, does my budget reset back to $25,000 now that we’re using Maven?**
A: No, your total budget in Maven will reflect any amount used in the past. For example, if you have submitted $10,000 worth of reimbursements through Airbase your Maven wallet total will show the remaining $15,000.

**Q: Does my Maven wallet update with each approved reimbursement?**
A: Yes, every time your reimbursement request is approved you will see your updated remaining balance in the Maven wallet.

**Q: How long do I have to submit reimbursement requests?**

Sourcegraph People Team and Payroll receive a report with totals for payroll reimbursements and tax purposes, but otherwise do not have access to any services you utilize or reimbursement details.

**Q: How does my flexible saving account (FSA) work with Maven?**
A: Maven is a health benefit in addition to your FSA. You must exhaust your yearly FSA funds attached to a Sourcegraph insurance plan prior to using the family support budget provided by Sourcegraph. If your parnter has an FSA that is not Sourcegraph sponsored, meaning an FSA through their employer, they do not need to exhaust the FSA first.
