## Sourcegraph Background Check Policy

### Policy purpose

Sourcegraph is committed to earning and maintaining the trust of our customers as they trust us with sensitive information including their source code. One of the ways we enhance customer trust is by requiring Teammates to satisfactorily complete appropriate background checks, where permitted by law. The purpose of this Background Check Policy (“**Policy**”) is to promote consistent background check policies.

### Policy scope

This Policy applies to the following positions and roles (“**Covered Teammates**”), where permissible and subject to applicable laws:

- All current Sourcegraph teammates as of this Policy’s effective date will be required to authorize and satisfactorily complete a criminal background check.
- Applicants after this Policy’s effective date will be required to satisfactorily complete a pre-hire (but post-offer) criminal background check, employment verification, and education verification.
- Teammates in certain roles with responsibility for financial matters may be required to authorize and satisfactorily complete a credit check.

### Policy overview

Subject to applicable law, all offers of engagement to candidates are contingent upon authorization and successful completion of a background check. Existing Covered Teammates may also be required to authorize and undergo a background check, upon request. Background check authorization forms (including, for Covered Teammates in the U.S., the _Disclosure and Authorization To Obtain Investigative Consumer Report_ form) provided by the People Team or the applicable third party vendor engaged by Sourcegraph must be timely completed. Background checks will be conducted by a designated third-party vendor in compliance with applicable law, including (for Covered Teammates in the U.S.), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“**FCRA**”). The guidelines for and scope of each type of background check are specified in this Policy.

We will notify Covered Teammates of the specific required checks in advance. Local laws may prohibit or restrict certain types of background checks. We’ll comply with applicable law at all times.

In reviewing the results of a background check, Sourcegraph will consider job scope and duties and customer requirements, among other factors, in determining what constitutes “satisfactory completion.” All information obtained as a result of a background check will be used solely for employment or engagement purposes. Teammates are entitled to request copies of background check information to the extent authorized by applicable state or country law.

### Process

1. Teammates will be provided with appropriate notice of our intention to obtain information through a background check.
2. Teammates will be asked to authorize a background check before the check is performed.
3. Refusal to authorize a required background check or to timely complete an authorization form constitutes grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of your working relationship with Sourcegraph subject to applicable law.

### Scope and guidelines

#### Criminal background checks

All Covered Teammates will be subject to criminal background checks, where permissible by applicable laws.

- **Applicants:** Criminal background checks will be conducted on applicants only after they have accepted a conditional offer of employment / engagement.
- **Current Teammates:** Criminal background checks will be conducted on current teammates as of this Policy’s effective date within two (2) months of the effective date.

_Length of History Searched:_ For Covered Teammates in the U.S. and subject to any additional local restrictions, there will be no inquiry regarding any criminal offense that is more than seven (7) years old. For Covered Teammates outside the U.S., Sourcegraph will follow similar restrictions in accordance with applicable law.

_Convictions Only (no arrests or detentions absent a conviction):_ For Covered Teammates in the U.S. and subject to any additional local restrictions, there will be no inquiry regarding any arrest or detention that did not result in a conviction or any conviction that has been judicially dismissed or ordered sealed pursuant to law. For Covered Teammates outside the U.S., Sourcegraph will follow similar restrictions in accordance with applicable law.

### Education, employment, and reference verification

Verification of educational achievement, including but not limited to the awarding of any required degree or certification, will generally be conducted with respect to Covered Teammates whose roles require a specific level or type of formal education, as noted in the applicable job description and/or open position posting, and subject to applicable laws.

The Covered Teammate’s hiring manager or People Team will directly contact professional references identified by the Covered Teammate. Applicants must inform their professional references in advance and must obtain the referee’s consent to share their contact information with Sourcegraph.

Sourcegraph will not retroactively conduct such verifications for current Teammates, absent a business requirement, such as to fulfill a customer contractual obligation.

The People Team will review and analyze third-party vendor verification results and store the record of the completed verification in the Teammate’s file.

### Results review

Upon receipt of a Teammate’s background check results, Sourcegraph will conduct an individualized assessment of Covered Teammates with criminal convictions on a case-by-case basis. The fact that someone has a prior conviction does not automatically mean their working relationship with Sourcegraph will not commence or will be terminated. Sourcegraph considers relevant factors when reviewing results, including:

- Relevance of reported offenses to the Teammate’s role
- Severity level of reported offenses
- Time elapsed since most recent conviction
- Number of convictions for the same type(s) of offense
- Teammate’s age at the time of the offense(s)
- Relevant evidence of rehabilitation
- Explanatory information provided by the Covered Teammate
- Any other factors required by law

Before taking any adverse action on the basis of a criminal background check (such as rescinding a conditional offer or terminating a current teammate’s working relationship with Sourcegraph), the People Partner should consult with legal counsel.

Sourcegraph will notify any Teammates whose employment or engagement status may be affected by the outcome of a background check (including criminal background checks, employment verifications, education verifications, and any other applicable checks), in accordance with applicable laws. In some locations, Teammates will have an opportunity to respond to any preliminary adverse determinations made as a result of a background check. Where required, Teammates will be informed when notified of the preliminary determination of their right to respond to the notice of the preliminary decision before the decision becomes final, their ability to provide evidence challenging the accuracy of the background check results, evidence of rehabilitation or mitigating circumstances, or both; and the deadline by which to respond.

### Confidentiality

All background check information will be kept confidential and shared only with those who have a need to know in order to administer this policy or make a determination as to a Teammate’s working relationship with Sourcegraph. Any information collected will be processed in accordance with applicable data privacy law.

### Policy changes

Sourcegraph has the right to amend, change or update this Policy in its sole discretion and without prior notice, unless otherwise provided for by law. Nothing in this Policy constitutes an agreement for continued employment or modifies the nature of a Covered Teammate’s employment or engagement with Sourcegraph, as provided in the applicable offer letter or contract. In the event of a conflict between this Policy and local laws, local laws control.
