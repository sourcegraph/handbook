# **Total Rewards**

We want our teammates to be happy, healthy, and productive. In order to best support that, we provide competitive pay, perks, and benefits. In other words, we offer total rewards which is the total calculation of all categories Sourcegraph spends on each teammate outside of software and hardware used to be successful in their role. Below is a breakdown of categories that make up total rewards.

## **What makes up total rewards?**

- [Compensation](../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/index.md)
  - Base
  - Variable (where applicable)
- Equity
- [Perks](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/index.md#perks)
- [Health Benefits (US based teammates)](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/index.md#benefits)

**Total rewards =** annual compensation + annual projected equity value + monetary perks + average annual spend on health benefits

You can view your total rewards package in your Assemble profile. Follow the directions [here](../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/index.md#pay-transparency).

## **Compensation**

We pay competitively in order to attract the best possible talent to Sourcegraph and reward Teammates for the work that they do. We are committed to keeping compensation competitive, merit-based, and non-discriminatory, to make sure all Teammates have a financial stake in the success of Sourcegraph and that contributions are rewarded.

To review our full compensation philosophy review our [Compensation & Pay Transparency page.](../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/index.md) Additional handbook pages for a deeper look into compensation at Sourcegraph are listed below:

### **Components of compensation**

At Sourcegraph, we aim to hire the best possible talent and want to ensure our Teammates feel valued from a compensation standpoint. Our compensation package is one component of total rewards and is composed of: base pay and/or commission.

#### **Base pay:**

Each [job level](../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/leveling-guide.md) has a corresponding compensation band. Our band entry points are benchmarked to the 75th percentile of US technology company market data, and the top of the band is 15% above the band entry point. We re-set salary bands every six months in alignment with our [Impact Review Process](../people-talent/people-ops/process/teammate-sentiment/impact-reviews/index.md) to ensure our compensation remains up to date and market competitive. This means that every year, our band entry point may go up, down, or stay the same. And if our band goes down, we will never decrease our teammate’s pay.

If we are given reason to believe that Radford data doesn’t match existing market rates, we may leverage other data sources to verify and/or adjust the band. In addition, the People Team reserves the right to manually adjust any band at any time to benefit the business and our teammates.

#### **Commission:**

We provide [Commission compensation](../finance/process/commissions.md) in the form of commissions for roles that are measured by numerical performance. At this point, only certain roles in the Sales and Customer Engineering organizations are eligible for commission.

## **Equity**

The second component of total rewards is Equity. We are an early-stage company, and every Teammate can have a huge impact on our success. We want to make sure that everyone has a financial stake in our success and that contributions are rewarded.

Our equity grants vest over four years. Once you have met your 1-year cliff your vesting shares and their estimated values begin contributing to your annual total rewards equation.

To learn more about equity at Sourcegraph visit our [equity FAQ](../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/equity-faq.md) and our Handbook page on [how and when stock option grants are calculated](../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/compensation/equity-timing.md#sts=Option%20grant%20timing).

## **Perks**

Sourcegraph feels strongly about investing in their teammates and ensuring they have the tools to be successful in their role. We group perks towards recharging, growing skills, and creating a strong culture of connectedness. Our perks are broken into three categories. Below you will find an overview of each category and our [Perks & Benefits overview handbook page](../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/index.md#perks) provides details for each perk.
