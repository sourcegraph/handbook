### **Giving great feedback**

Giving great feedback to fellow Teammates is just one of the ways in which we put into practice Sourcegraph's value of Continuous Growth. On this page, you'll find suggestions on how to deliver clear, actionable feedback. We recommend using the Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) model when crafting 360 reviews.

### Writing effective peer reviews

Feedback from Teammates we work closely with is some of the most valuable we will give, and receive, during the Impact Review Cycle. We encourage Teammates to give each other feedback throughout the year, but the bi-annual Impact Review is a chance to give specific feedback in a more formal way.

The most valuable peer feedback is specific and actionable. We recommend using the Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) model as a guide to giving great feedback. SBI is a simple, yet direct, method that allows for clear, easy to understand, feedback to be given and received.

SBI is a straightforward model with three simple components:

- **Situation:** the where and when (shaping the context of the feedback)
- **Behavior:** the observable action (what you observed directly, not your interpretation)
- **Impact:** the so-what (effect on emotion and work)

To assist Teammates through the review writing process, we have provided several examples below on how a Teammate might utilize the SBI model to deliver meaningful and impactful feedback to peers.

**Sample Review Question:** How have this Teammate's contributions impacted your ability to deliver on your goals?

**Example Answer:** Hermione is exceptional at Charms. **_(Situation:)_** In June, I was invited to speak at HippogriffCon about Charm Search. Because Hermione is an expert at Charms, I reached out to her for help. **_(Behavior:)_** Hermione really exemplified our value Work as a Team by jumping into help. She noticed that my presentation was bland and used a Colour Change Charm to spice it up. She went above-and-beyond by using a Cheering Charm when I was feeling discouraged by the project. **_(Impact:)_** The presentation was a huge success and generated 123 new customer leads. Not only that, but reflecting on the time leading up to the presentation, I absolutely could not have finished it without her - the Cheering Charm came at the perfect time and really helped push us over the finish line!

**Sample Review Question:** Based on your interactions with this person, which role-specific competency or values would you recommend they focus on in order to grow professionally?

**Example Answer:** I would like to see Hermione improve at listening to others' ideas in meetings. **_(Situation:)_** While working on the chamber of secrets project, I found a diary that appeared blank, but I suspected had information in it that we could figure out how to access. **_(Behavior:)_** When I presented this to the team, Hermione repeatedly interrupted me before I could finish, saying it was obviously blank and we couldn't use it. **_(Impact:)_** This undermined my presentation before I was able to explain my theory, and I was not able to get the team to buy-in. While Hermione was still able to successfully deliver the potion ahead of schedule to save the school, it is still vital to actively listen / seek feedback from teammates to create opportunities for shared learning and success.

**Sample Review Question:** Please share any additional feedback that may help this Teammate grow in their career.

**Example Answer:** **_(Situation:)_** To continue to grow in her career, **_(Behavior:)_** Hermione can increase her impact by documenting her spells in the Source(rer)graph handbook. **_(Impact:)_** Documenting spells in the handbook will allow new teammates, and her teammates who cast spells in a different time zone, to learn from her work asynchronously, which will increase her impact beyond 1:1 mentoring sessions.

### **Writing an effective self review**

The Self Review is an essential and valuable part of our bi-annual 360 Impact Review Cycle. Your Self Review is a chance to celebrate and reflect on your performance over the past six months. It is also an opportunity to showcase ways in which you live our values through your work, and communicate what you’d like to focus on in the next six months.

As part of your Self Review, you’ll be asked to share examples of your most impactful accomplishments over the past 6 months. We encourage Teammates to use the Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) model to describe your accomplishments in a clear and concise way. You may also find the SBI model helpful as you draft Peer Reviews and Upward Reviews (Teammate-to-Manager Reviews).

SBI is a straightforward model with three simple components:

- **Situation:** the where and when (shaping the context of the feedback)
- **Behavior:** the observable action (what you observed directly, not your interpretation)
- **Impact:** the so-what (effect on emotion and work)

The below examples utilize the SBI model to frame accomplishments with clear ties to impact.

Sample Review Question: What were your most impactful accomplishments over the past 6 months?

**Example Answer:** I am still establishing myself as a contributing member of Hogwarts. Over the past 6 months, I successfully demonstrated my ability to troubleshoot routine magical situations with little guidance, in addition I'm finding myself increasingly independent when asked to tackle more complex spells.

For example, **_(Situation:)_** I worked on the Chamber of Secrets project with two other Wizards, Ron and Harry. When I first joined the project, the team was blocked trying to figure out how to find the chamber of secrets, and the project was at risk. **_(Behavior:)_** I suggested brewing polyjuice potion, researched how to do it, and successfully brewed it autonomously. **_(Impact:)_** As a result, the team was able to take the potion, learn the location of the chamber of secrets, and destroy Tom Riddle's diary successfully, saving the school.

**Sample Review Question:** To what extent did you meet your commitments or goals in the past 6 months?

**Example Answer:** I started the year knowing I would be expected to perform well on my Ordinary Wizarding Levels (OWLs). **_(Situation:)_** I knew that to do my absolute best on my OWLs I would need to take extra courses to achieve the highest scores. **_(Behavior:)_** Knowing the Restricted Section of the library contains many ancient texts, with a variety of suggestions on how to achieve Wizarding academic excellence, I researched several options for how I might perform my absolute best on the OWLs with the limited time I have in the day for study. I discovered the existence of Time Turners. I consulted with my professors and, with the help of Professor McGonnagal, was able to obtain permission for use of a Time Turner from the Ministry of Magic. **_(Impact:)_** Use of the Time Turner allowed me to take Divination and Muggle Studies, in addition to my regular course load. Extra courses, coupled with extra time for study, allowed me to perform well on my OWLs.

**Sample Review Question:** What are you looking to achieve in your next 6 months at [Hogwarts]?

**Example Answer:** In the next six months, I would like to successfully cast the Patronus spell. **_(Situation:)_** Dementors are going to take over the school and will be a problem for me and my friends. **_(Behavior:)_** I will reach out to Professor Lupin for help with casting, and perfecting, the spell. **_(Impact:)_** The Patronus spell will help us defend ourselves, should the need arise.

### Writing an effective Manager-to-Teammate review

People leaders at Sourcegraph play a vital role in shaping the experiences of their team members. While we encourage Managers to provide continuous feedback throughout the year, whether it be via Regular 1:1s or Career Conversations, our bi-annual 360 Impact Review Cycle provides a great opportunity where in-depth, formal feedback can be provided both ways: Teammate-to-Manager, as well as Manager-to-Teammate.

When it comes time for a Manager to write up a performance review on their direct report, many come to realize that it is much easier said than done. Successfully drafting and delivering a meaningful review to a Teammate is no small feat! At Sourcegraph, we encourage our Managers to frame feedback utilizing the Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) model. SBI is a simple, yet direct, method that allows for clear, easy to understand, feedback to be given and received.

SBI is a straightforward model with three simple components:

- **Situation:** the where and when (shaping the context of the feedback)
- **Behavior:** the observable action (what you observed directly, not your interpretation)
- **Impact:** the so-what (effect on emotion and work)

To assist Managers through the review writing process, we have provided several examples below on how a Manager might utilize the SBI model to deliver the most meaningful and impactful review to a team member.

**Sample Review Question:** How has this Teammate's performance mapped to the expectations of their role and level over the past 6 months? (Reference the career development framework if applicable). To what extent did they meet their commitments?

**Example Answer:** As an IC1, Hermione is still establishing herself as a contributing member of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and is expected to possess a basic understanding of potion brewing. Over the past 6 months, Hermione has successfully demonstrated that she is able to troubleshoot routine magical situations with little guidance, in addition to independently solving more complex wizardry issues.

For example, **_(Situation:)_** Hermione worked on the Chamber of Secrets project with two IC1 Wizards, Ron and Harry. When she joined the project, the team was blocked trying to figure out how to find the chamber of secrets, and the project was at risk. **_(Behavior:)_** Hermione joined the project, came up with the idea of brewing polyjuice potion, researched how to do it, and successfully brewed it autonomously. **_(Impact:)_** As a result, the team was able to take the potion, learn the location of the chamber of secrets, and destroy Tom Riddle's diary successfully, saving the school.

This exceeded my expectations in Proficiency and Execution for an IC1 Wizard because of the technical complexity and precision required to brew the potion. This potion is not taught until an individual reaches level IC3, takes 21 days to prepare, one month total to brew, and contains 6 complex components to create. Hermione scoped out all of the requirements to this complex, ambiguously defined task, explained the reasoning and trade-offs behind their technical decisions to the other wizards on the team, created all 6 components, and delivered the potion ahead of schedule, which exceeded my expectations for an IC1.

**Sample Review Question:** What are the areas in which you would like to see this person improve? (Please provide examples from the last 6 months).

**Example Answer:** I would like to see Hermione improve at listening to others' ideas in meetings. **_(Situation:)_** While working on the chamber of secrets project, I found a diary that appeared blank, but I suspected had information in it that we could figure out how to access. **_(Behavior:)_** When I presented this to the team, Hermione repeatedly interrupted me before I could finish, saying it was obviously blank and we couldn't use it. **_(Impact:)_** This undermined my presentation before I was able to explain my theory, and I was not able to get the team to buy-in. While Hermione was still able to successfully deliver the potion ahead of schedule to save the school, it is still vital to actively listen / seek feedback from teammates to create opportunities for shared learning and success.

**Sample Review Question:** How does this person's behavior align with our values? (Provide 2-3 specific examples).

**Example Answer:** Hermione embodies our Source(rer)graph value of high agency. **_(Situation:)_** When Hermione initially joined the Chamber of Secrets project, we had just lost our IC3 teammate who had been leading the initiative. **_(Behavior:)_** Hermione willingly took on the role as an interim team lead, guiding Harry and Ron through the process of researching and creating the complex polyjuice potion, which typically is not taught until a witch or wizard has reached level IC3. **_(Impact:)_** Without the potion, we would not have been successful in destroying Tom Riddle's diary and saving the school.

**Sample Review Question:** How do you see this person's role evolving over the next 6 months? What are the key competencies that they should focus on?

**Example Answer:** **_(Situation:)_** To continue to grow in her career, **_(Behavior:)_** Hermione can increase her impact by documenting her spells in the Source(rer)graph handbook. **_(Impact:)_** Documenting spells in the handbook will allow new teammates, and her teammates who cast spells in a different time zone, to learn from her work asynchronously, which will increase her impact beyond 1:1 mentoring sessions.
