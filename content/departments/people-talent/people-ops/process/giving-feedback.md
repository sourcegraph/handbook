### **Tips for writing great reviews**

- **No surprises**: what you write in your review should never be a surprise to the teammate receiving the feedback. We believe in direct and [continuous feedback](../../../../company-info-and-process/working-at-sourcegraph/teammate-development/index.md#2-continuous-feedback), so please ensure you don’t wait until the impact review process to share feedback on how a teammate should improve.
- **Be specific**: focus on specific and concrete examples to support your ratings and feedback. This will make your review more impactful and memorable. You should never give feedback without providing supporting examples. The [SBI model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R6c78xV9GpMdOX3jnZBg7GxUbcPJcABfJgUsdpU-m-U/edit?usp=sharing) can be helpful to leverage in delivering great feedback.

  - **Situation:** what did you or the teammate do? Begin by describing the situation or context in which the performance took place. What were the expectations and goals for the task or project? Be specific and clear in setting the context for the review.
    - Example: "During the third quarter, the team was tasked with increasing sales in the Northeast region by 15%. The team's goal was to identify new prospects, deepen relationships with existing clients, and close deals."
  - **Behavior:** how you or the teammate did it(what you observed directly, not your interpretation or bias). Describe the behavior and actions in the situation. What was done to achieve the goals and expectations? Were there any specific tasks or responsibilities that you/they took on that stood out? Use specific examples to illustrate your points.
    - Example: "[Teammate name] took a proactive approach to identifying new prospects, conducting in-depth research to target high-potential clients. They also established strong relationships with key clients, resulting in several successful contract renewals. They consistently met or exceeded their sales targets, and their efforts helped the team achieve its overall goal."
  - **Impact:** what was the impact or ROI of the work product or action? Describe the impact of the behavior on the team or company. What positive results or outcomes did the actions generate? Be specific and use data or metrics to support your claims whenever possible.
    - Example: "Thanks to [Teammate name]'s efforts, the team was able to exceed our sales target for the quarter by 20%. Their contributions helped to build stronger relationships with our clients, resulting in an increase in repeat business and higher customer satisfaction ratings."

- **Provide balance**: when providing a self-review, it's important to be specific and provide concrete examples to support your rating, and to strike a balance between being confident and self-assured, and being humble and open to feedback. When writing reviews on other teammates, strike a balance between being positive and constructive. Acknowledge your teammate's strengths and successes, while also providing constructive feedback & specific areas for improvement.
- **Make it actionable**: use language that is clear, concise, and non-judgmental. Avoid using negative or accusatory language, and instead, focus on objective and actionable feedback.
- **Be concise**: reviews don’t have to be long to be impactful. We recommend anywhere from 300-1000 words max. Anything longer is unnecessary.
- **Don’t overthink**: the time it takes to write a review can vary depending on the person. Some teammates can write a review in 15-minutes, and others need an hour. If you are taking more than an hour to write one review, please reach out to your People Partner for support. It is likely that you are writing too much or overthinking the review.
  - Please feel free to use technology, like ChatGPT and Anthropic, to help speed up the review writing process!
- **Rating scale**: you can read more about our rating scale definitions in the handbook [here](teammate-sentiment/impact-reviews/index.md#rating-definitions).

### **Writing an effective self review**

A self review is your chance to celebrate and reflect on your performance over the past six months. It is also an opportunity to showcase ways in which you live our values through your work, communicate how you’d like to grow in the next six months, and indicate to your manager where you need support.

**Example - self review**

### Writing effective peer reviews

Feedback from teammates we work closely with is some of the most valuable we will give, and receive, during the impact review process. We encourage teammates to give each other direct and actionable feedback regularly throughout the year, but the bi-annual impact review is a chance to give specific feedback in a more formal way.

**Example - peer review**

  <tr>
   <td><strong>Peer Review Question</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Example Response</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>

### Writing effective manager-to-teammate reviews

People leaders at Sourcegraph play a vital role in shaping the experiences of their team members. While we encourage managers to provide [continuous feedback throughout the year](../../../../company-info-and-process/working-at-sourcegraph/teammate-development/index.md#2-continuous-feedback), whether it be via Regular 1:1s or career conversations, our bi-annual impact reviews provide a great opportunity where in-depth, formal feedback can be provided both ways: teammate-to-manager, as well as manager-to-teammate.

When it comes time for a manager to write performance reviews about their direct reports, many come to realize that it is much easier said than done. Successfully drafting and delivering a meaningful review to a teammate is no small feat, but it is incredibly important to provide thoughtful feedback to help guide and support teammate growth and development. The key to a successful review is to be thorough, honest, and clear, while also focusing on both strengths and areas for improvement. By taking the time to carefully consider the teammate's performance and by actively engaging in an open dialogue, a manager can help foster a culture of continuous improvement and growth, and create a foundation for future success.

Once all reviews are written and the manager has gone through the [calibration process](compensation-and-leveling/preparing-for-calibrations.md) with the people team, it is necessary that you deliver the feedback in an effective way. You can read more about delivering impact review feedback [here](teammate-sentiment/impact-reviews/index.md#delivering-the-review-to-teammates).

### Writing effective Direct Report-to-manager reviews

Gathering feedback from a manager's direct reports is important in the performance review process because it provides a more comprehensive and well-rounded view of the manager's performance. Direct reports are in a unique position to observe the manager's day-to-day behavior, communication style, and leadership skills, and can provide valuable insights into areas of strength and areas for improvement. This feedback can help managers understand how they are perceived by their team and make necessary changes to improve their management style and overall effectiveness. Additionally, involving direct reports in the performance review process can increase their engagement and sense of ownership in the company, and promote a culture of open communication and continuous improvement.
