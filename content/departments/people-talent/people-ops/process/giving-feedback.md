### **Tips for writing great reviews**

- **No surprises**: what you write in your review should never be a surprise to the teammate receiving the feedback. We believe in direct and continuous feedback [insert HB link], so please ensure you don’t wait until the impact review process to share feedback on how a teammate should improve.
- **Be specific**: focus on specific and concrete examples to support your ratings and feedback. This will make your review more impactful and memorable. You should never give feedback without providing supporting examples. The [SBI model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R6c78xV9GpMdOX3jnZBg7GxUbcPJcABfJgUsdpU-m-U/edit?usp=sharing) can be helpful to leverage in delivering great feedback.
  - **Situation:** what did you or the teammate do?
  - **Behavior:** how you or the teammate did it
  - **Impact:** what was the impact or ROI of the work product or action?
- **Provide balance**: when providing a self-review, It's important to be specific and provide concrete examples to support your rating, and to strike a balance between being confident and self-assured, and being humble and open to feedback.  When writing reviews on other teammates, strike a balance between being positive and constructive. Acknowledge your teammate's strengths and successes, while also providing constructive feedback & specific areas for improvement. 
- **Make it actionable**: use language that is clear, concise, and non-judgmental. Avoid using negative or accusatory language, and instead, focus on objective and actionable feedback.
- **Be concise**: reviews don’t have to be long to be impactful. We recommend anywhere from 300-1000 words max. Anything longer is unnecessary.
- **Don’t overthink**: the time it takes to write a review can vary depending on the person. Some teammates can write a review in 15-minutes, and others need an hour. If you are taking more than an hour to write one review, please reach out to your People Partner for support. It is likely that you are writing too much or overthinking the review. You can also use technology, like ChatGPT, to help speed up the review writing process.

### **Writing an effective self review**

A self review is your chance to celebrate and reflect on your performance over the past six months. It is also an opportunity to showcase ways in which you live our values through your work, communicate how you’d like to grow in the next six months, and indicate to your manager where you need support.

### Writing effective peer reviews

Feedback from teammates we work closely with is some of the most valuable we will give, and receive, during the impact review process. We encourage teammates to give each other direct and actionable feedback regularly throughout the year, but the bi-annual impact review is a chance to give specific feedback in a more formal way.

### Writing effective manager-to-teammate reviews

People leaders at Sourcegraph play a vital role in shaping the experiences of their team members. While we encourage managers to provide [continuous feedback throughout the year](INSERT LINK TO CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK HB PAGE COMING SOON), whether it be via Regular 1:1s or career conversations, our bi-annual impact reviews provide a great opportunity where in-depth, formal feedback can be provided both ways: teammate-to-manager, as well as manager-to-teammate.

When it comes time for a manager to write performance reviews about their direct reports, many come to realize that it is much easier said than done. Successfully drafting and delivering a meaningful review to a teammate is no small feat, but it is incredibly important to provide thoughtful feedback to help guide and support teammate growth and development. The key to a successful review is to be thorough, honest, and clear, while also focusing on both strengths and areas for improvement. By taking the time to carefully consider the teammate's performance and by actively engaging in an open dialogue, a manager can help foster a culture of continuous improvement and growth, and create a foundation for future success.

Once all reviews are written and the manager has gone through the [calibration process](COMING SOON) with the people team, it is necessary that you deliver the feedback in an effective way. You can read more about delivering impact review feedback [here](COMING SOON).

### Writing effective teammate-to-manager review

Gathering feedback from a manager's direct reports is important in the performance review process because it provides a more comprehensive and well-rounded view of the manager's performance. Direct reports are in a unique position to observe the manager's day-to-day behavior, communication style, and leadership skills, and can provide valuable insights into areas of strength and areas for improvement. This feedback can help managers understand how they are perceived by their team and make necessary changes to improve their management style and overall effectiveness. Additionally, involving direct reports in the performance review process can increase their engagement and sense of ownership in the company, and promote a culture of open communication and continuous improvement.
