# Name Change Process

This process is for Sourcegraph teammates who have a legal, preferred, or dead name change. There are several steps required to ensure accurate records and compliance with legal requirements.

### Step 1 Notify People Ops

- Notify people-ops@sourcegraph.com as soon as possible with your name change request.
- Please include whether this is a legal name change, preferred name change, or dead name change.
- If a legal change, include legal documentation such as a court order, marriage certificate, etc. to show proof of the name change.

### Step 2: People Ops will review the request and verify the document(s) as valid

For legal name changes, if documents are not found to be valid, [people-ops@sourcegraph.com](mailto:people-ops@sourcegraph.com) will reply to your emailed request to let you know it has been denied.

### Step 3: People Ops will notify cross-functional stakeholders via email

The teammateâ€™s name will need to be updated across various systems by various stakeholders

- If the employee interacts with customers, clients, or vendors, consider notifying them of the name change to maintain transparency.
- Slack profile
- Gmail signature
- Human Interest (if legal name change)
