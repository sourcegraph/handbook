# Deel - PEO/EOR employment

[Deel](https://www.deel.com/) is a privately-held payroll and compliance provider. That means anyone, anywhere can get hired and paid with Deel. Using a tech-enabled self-serve process, companies can legally hire full-time employees or independent contractors across the world. We use Deel to hire international employees and contractors. We refer to Deel and similar providers as Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) or Employer of Record (EORs).

Deel acts as the intermediary between you (the employee) and the company you're working for. Deel engages with both parties using separate agreements. While you perform your duties at the company, you get hired and paid by Deel.

## How can I get employed via a PEO/EOR?

During your interview process, your recruiter will explain the different types of employment available. Should you choose to come in on a PEO/EOR, they will ask you for certain details and then notify you as soon as the request has been approved.

After the People Ops team and the Finance team set everything up for you on the backend, Deel will contact you, notify you and request your signature.
