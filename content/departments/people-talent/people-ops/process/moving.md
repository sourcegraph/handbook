## **Moving and relocation**

Planning a move? It’s easy! Sourcegraph is a fully remote company, and our teammates can work all over the world.

All moves require updated addresses in our systems of record. Some moves, including moves between two countries, require Teammates to notify our People team.

## All moves

All moves require an updated address. This helps us ensure appropriate payroll taxes are applied. Ultimately, you are responsible for updating your location and paying taxes as required by law. To update your address:

- Note: please submit your change of address **within seven calendar days of your move and at least seven calendar days before the following payroll date** to make sure your change is reflected in time and to ensure you are taxed correctly.
- Note: Teammates enrolled in a Kaiser health plan may be prompted to re-enroll in health benefits via [Rippling], if Kaiser is not available in the state you move to (https://app.rippling.com/insurance/employee/qle/init).
