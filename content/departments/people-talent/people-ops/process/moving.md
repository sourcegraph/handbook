# Moving and relocation

Planning a move? Itâ€™s easy! Sourcegraph is a fully remote company, and our teammates can work all over the world.

All moves require updated addresses in our systems of record. Some moves, including moves between two countries, require Teammates to notify our People team.

## All moves

All moves require an updated address. This helps us ensure appropriate payroll taxes are applied. Ultimately, you are responsible for updating your location and paying taxes as required by law. To update your address:

**US teammates:**

- You will update your address in [BambooHR](https://help.bamboohr.com/hc/en-us/articles/227321928-Employee-Access-Manual#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20update%20my%20information%3F) and in [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/insurance/employee/qle/init).

- Note: please submit your change of address **within seven calendar days of your move and at least seven calendar days before the following payroll date** to make sure your change is reflected in time and to ensure you are taxed correctly.
- Note: Teammates enrolled in a Kaiser health plan may be prompted to re-enroll in health benefits via [Rippling](https://app.rippling.com/insurance/employee/qle/init), if Kaiser is not available in the state you move to.

**Non-US teammates:**

Please update your home address and work address in [BambooHR](https://help.bamboohr.com/hc/en-us/articles/227321928-Employee-Access-Manual#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20update%20my%20information%3F).

- Note: submit your change of address **within seven calendar days of your move.**

## Cross-border moves

Moving to another country? Moving cross-border is more complex with taxes, and possible visa requirements. Notify people-ops@sourcegraph.com of your intent to work in a new location, as well as when you expect to begin working from that location and we will begin the approval process. Notify the People Team **at least** 30 days prior to your planned move.

Cross-border moves require require the following:

- Teammates must be eligible for employment in the country the work from
- A new employment contract and/or arrangement (our People & Talent Team will help with this)
- An updated address (outlined above)
