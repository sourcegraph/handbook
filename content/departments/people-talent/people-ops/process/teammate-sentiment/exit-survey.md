Additionally, a member of our People team will also reach out to schedule a live exit meeting. We ask that you complete the survey prior to the exit meeting. Our People team member will ask you about your reasons for leaving and your overall experience at Sourcegraph. Think of this as a deeper dive into your exit survey responses. While the exit survey is intended to capture quantitative data about why teammates leave, the exit meeting helps us capture qualitative data. The meeting is conversational.

Though both the exit survey and exit meeting are optional, we highly encourage your participation! By giving feedback as you’re leaving, you’ll help us continue to build an exceptional place to work so we can continuously grow.
