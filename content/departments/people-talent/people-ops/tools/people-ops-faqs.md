This page is meant as a resource to find answers to questions frequently asked by teammates in the #ask-people-team Slack channel. Below you will find information on topics such as benefits, immigration support, moving, and more.

## US work authorization: I-9 verification

### Q. What documentation do I need to present to confirm my eligibility to legally work in the US?

**US teammates:**

- Within your first 3 days at Sourcegraph, you are required to complete an I-9 form and present valid documentation that shows your identity and authorization to work in the US. You can find a list of acceptable documents [here](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-acceptable-documents). **Please ensure your documentation is up to date** prior to your start date. If your documentation is expired, it is not valid and your start date will be delayed.
- We use a vendor called Workbright to facilitate our I-9 verification remotely. You will receive an email from Workbright to your personal email on Day 1.
