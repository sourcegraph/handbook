# Resources for People Team - Internal teammate gifting

This page is intended for internal People team use. It outlines when we gift internal teammates, how we send gifts, what gifts are sent, and who we partner with to fulfill our gifting initiatives.

- [New hires](internal-swag.md#New-hire-gifting)
- [Promotions](internal-swag.md#Promotion-gifting)
- [New babies](internal-swag.md#New-baby-gifting)
- Company offsites

Managers are responsible for sending gifts for:

- [Birthdays](internal-swag.md#Work-anniversary-and-birthday-gifting)
- [Work anniversaries](internal-swag.md#Work-anniversary-and-birthday-gifting)
- [Team accomplishments](internal-swag.md#Additional-Gifting/Swag)

## Who we partner with to send gifts to teammates

- [Telescope](https://www.telescopestudio.com/) - New hire kits, promotion gifts, new baby gifts, and other miscellaneous internal gifting requests
- [Loop & Tie](https://www.loopandtie.com/) - Birthdays and work anniversaries

## New hire gifting

We currently offer [these items](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#new-hires) in our new hire gifts.

**Reordering inventory**

The People Team can view inventory levels in our [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/) and in the monthly inventory report sent via email from Telescope.

Telescope monitors the inventory levels and production timeframes of each item and will reach out via email for re-order approval at the necessary times to avoid running out of stock. Inventory production turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks.

Telescope emails order the invoices to Finance and Kemper/Michal and Finance actions.

**How new hires order their gift**

After a new hire signs their contract with us, the People team sends an email that includes a link to order their new hire welcome kit and this information: "Order your Sourcegraph swag pack! Use the link below to select your T-shirt and hoodie size, provide your shipping address and start date, and place your order."

The new hire is responsible for submitting their order, which will then be fulfilled using inventory that we have in stock with [Telescope](https://www.telescopestudio.com/).

Once an order is placed, the new hire will get an email confirmation with delivery details. Sourcegraph covers the shipping cost, which varies depending on the shipping destination. We can view recent shipping costs in the invoices Telescope emails to PeopleOps/Finance.

## Promotion gifting

The People Team is currently working to develop a custom promotion gift, but in the meantime, we encourage Managers to [share the news broadly and recognize their teammates’ accomplishments!](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#promotions)

**Reordering inventory**

The People Team can view inventory levels in our [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/) and in the monthly inventory report sent via email from Telescope.

Telescope monitors the inventory levels and production timeframes of each item and will reach out via email for re-order approval at the necessary times to avoid running out of stock. Inventory production turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks. Best practice is to work with Telescope ahead of each Impact Review season to ensure we’re prepared for upcoming estimated promotion gifting.

Telescope emails the order invoices to Finance and Kemper/Michal and Finance actions.

**How the People Team sends promotion gifts**

For one-off promotions, gifts will be ordered by the People team through the [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/). Simply select 'Kits' from the menu bar, then select the Promotion kit, and checkout using the teammates' shipping address listed BambooHR.

To send promotion gifts in bulk, create a spreadsheet with each teammate's name, email, shipping address. Then, email the spreadsheet to chloe@telescopestudio.com and kyra@telescopestudio.com.

## New baby gifting

We currently offer [these items](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#new-babies) in our new baby gifts.

**Reordering inventory**

The people team can view inventory levels in our [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/) and in the monthly inventory report sent via email from Telescope.

Telescope monitors the inventory levels and production timeframes of each item and will reach out via email for re-order approval at the necessary times to avoid running out of stock. Inventory production turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks.

Telescope emails the order invoices to Finance and Kemper/Michal and Finance actions.

**How the People Team sends baby gifts**

The People team sends a new baby gift at the beginning of a teammates' parental leave. This gift will be ordered by the People team through the [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/). Simply select 'Kits' from the menu bar, then select the Baby Kit, and checkout using the teammates' shipping address listed BambooHR.

## Work anniversary and birthday gifting

Managers are responsible for sending anniversary and birthday gifts to their teammates. Our recommendation is for managers to use [Loop & Tie](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#loop--tie), which will be put onto a company card and then later reclassed into the correct team’s budget.

**People Team actions:**

- Every Monday, Kemper sends this slack message to managers who have teammates with a birthday or anniversary in the upcoming week:
  \_Hi [Manager Name]! Friendly reminder that it is [Teammate’s Name]’s [Birthday/Anniversary] on [Date].
  _Please:_
  - _Make a post in #thanks if you haven’t already (suggestions can be found here)_
  - _[Order a Loop & Tie gift](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#loop--tie)_
  - _Respond with a :white_check_mark: when both of the above actions are completed!_
- On the 1st of each month, the People team (Kemper) will send an email to finance@sourcegraph.com with a breakdown of what charges have been placed on the Loop & Tie card and which team’s to reclass the charges into.

## Additional Gifting/Swag

In the event a teammate wants to order custom gifts for other occasions, such as a team trip, team celebration, or any event that is not on [this list](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#when-we-send-gifts-to-teammates), we use [Telescope](https://www.telescopestudio.com/).

**The budget will be the responsibility of the team requesting the order - this must be confirmed prior to beginning the ordering process.**

Teammates can initiate an order by filling out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCBlGZA4HOEi3oh-uEQt2NaK9wh8qtWlVzfIAavkTJQQxz0w/viewform) to provide necessary information such as: the occasion, type of swag they want, delivery deadline, quantity, and countries for delivery.

After submitting the form, the People Team will start an email thread using the template below to connect the teammate with Telescope, who will facilitate the rest of the ordering process.

_Hi Telescope team,_
