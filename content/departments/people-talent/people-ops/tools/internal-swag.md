## New hire gifting

We currently offer [these items](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#new-hires) in our new hire gifts.

**Reordering inventory**

The People Team can view inventory levels in our [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/) and in the monthly inventory report sent via email from Telescope.

Telescope monitors the inventory levels and production timeframes of each item and will reach out via email for re-order approval at the necessary times to avoid running out of stock. Inventory production turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks.

Telescope emails order the invoices to Finance and Kemper/Michal and Finance actions.

**How new hires order their gift**

After a new hire signs their contract with us, the People team sends an email that includes a google form link to order their new hire welcome kit and this information: "Order your Sourcegraph swag pack! Use the link below to select your T-shirt and hoodie size, provide your shipping address and start date, and place your order."

The new hire is responsible for submitting the google form, which will then be fulfil their order using inventory that we have in stock with [Telescope](https://www.telescopestudio.com/). Form responses are sent to a google sheet shared between the People team and Telescope. Telescope will submit orders twice a week and touch base with the People team via email if expedited shipping is needed to get new hire kits to recipients before their start date.

Once an order is placed, the new hire will get an email confirmation with delivery details. Sourcegraph covers the shipping cost, which varies depending on the shipping destination. We can view recent shipping costs in the invoices Telescope emails to PeopleOps/Finance.

## Promotion gifting

The People Team is currently working to develop a custom promotion gift, but in the meantime, we encourage Managers to [share the news broadly and recognize their teammates’ accomplishments!](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#promotions)

**Reordering inventory**

The People Team can view inventory levels in our [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/) and in the monthly inventory report sent via email from Telescope.

Inventory production turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks. Best practice is to work with Telescope ahead of each Impact Review season to ensure we’re prepared for upcoming estimated promotion gifting.

Telescope emails the order invoices to Finance and Kemper/Michal and Finance actions.

**How the People Team sends promotion gifts**

For one-off promotions, gifts will be ordered by the People team through the [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/). Simply select 'Kits' from the menu bar, then select the Promotion kit, and checkout using the teammates' shipping address listed BambooHR.

To send promotion gifts in bulk, create a spreadsheet with each teammate's name, email, shipping address. Then, email the spreadsheet to chloe@telescopestudio.com and kyra@telescopestudio.com.

## Work anniversary and birthday gifting

The People team is responsible for sending anniversary and birthday gifts to their teammates. Managers are responsible for sending the teammates a note via Slack.

Each week, the People-Ops Team pulls the Birthday/Anniversary report from Bamboo. The People-Ops Team will audit the report and complete these two actions:

1. Send a Slack reminder to each manager who has a direct report with a birthday or anniversary that week. Remind them to post in the #thanks channel if their teammate is celebrating a work anniversary, or to post in the team channel or 1:1 if their teammate is celebrating a birthday.

- Slack message: Hi managers, we have XX celebrations this week.
  - Work Anniversaries - The People team will order a gift, but we need you to please make a post in #thanks (suggestions can be found here).
    - teammate name - xx years on xx date - @ manager name
    - teammate name - xx years on xx date - @ manager name
  - Birthdays - The People team will order a gift, but we need you to please send a celebratory Slack message in your team channel or directly to the teammate! Be considerate of all teammates and acknowledge that not everybody likes to be in the spotlight on their birthdays. Managers should ask the teammate personally if they’d like their birthday to be celebrated.
    - teammate name - birthday on xx date - @ manager name
    - teammate name - birthday on xx date - @ manager name
  - Pro Tip: You can schedule the slack messages to send on the correct dates.

2. Order a [Loop & Tie](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#loop--tie) gift for each teammate who is celebrating a birthday or anniversary that week. The Loop & Tie ordering process is outlined in [this loom](https://loom.com/share/c8141e51d8494e28840c16cd6f3839e1).

On the 1st of each month, the People-Ops team will send an email to finance@sourcegraph.com with a breakdown of the charges that have been placed on the Loop & Tie card by each team.

## Additional Gifting/Swag

In the event a teammate wants to order custom gifts for other occasions, such as a team trip, team celebration, or any event that is not on [this list](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#when-we-send-gifts-to-teammates), we use [Telescope](https://www.telescopestudio.com/).

**The budget will be the responsibility of the team requesting the order - this must be confirmed prior to beginning the ordering process.**

Teammates can initiate an order by filling out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCBlGZA4HOEi3oh-uEQt2NaK9wh8qtWlVzfIAavkTJQQxz0w/viewform) to provide necessary information such as: the occasion, type of swag they want, delivery deadline, quantity, and countries for delivery. Form responses can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YUz8_Bbd9H-Kip00da50iB_xZqQuQhSu7Y-1ghbI_jE/edit#responses).

After submitting the form, the People Team will start an email thread using the template below to connect the teammate with Telescope, who will facilitate the rest of the ordering process.
