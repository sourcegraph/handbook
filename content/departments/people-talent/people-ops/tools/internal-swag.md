# Resources for People Team - Internal teammate gifting

This page is intended for internal People team use. It outlines when we gift internal teammates, how we send gifts, what gifts are sent, and who we partner with to fulfill our gifting initiatives.

## When we send gifts to teammates

The People team is responsible for sending gifts for:

- New hires
- Promotions
- New babies
- Company Offsites

Managers are responsible for sending gifts for:

- Birthdays
- Work Anniversaries
- Team Accomplishments

## Who we partner with to send gifts to teammates

- [Telescope](https://www.telescopestudio.com/) - New Hire Kits, Promotion gifts, New Parent gifts, and other miscellaneous internal gifting requests
- [Loop & Tie](https://www.loopandtie.com/) - Birthdays and Work Anniversaries

## New hire gifting

We currently offer [these items](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#new-hire-kits) in our new hire gifts

The People team and our vendor, Telescope, will be monitoring inventory to ensure we have necessary items in stock. Inventory production turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks.

**Reordering inventory**
The people team can view inventory levels in our [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/) and in the monthly inventory report sent via email from Telescope.

Telescope monitors the inventory levels and production timeframes of each item and will reach out via email for re-order approval at the necessary times to avoid running out of stock. We pay via invoice. Telescope emails all invoices to Finance and Kemper/Michal and Finance actions.

**How new hires order their gift**

After a new hire signs their contract with us, the People team sends an email that includes a link to order their new hire welcome kit. The new hire is responsible for submitting their order, which will then be fulfilled using inventory that we have in stock with our vendor, Telescope.

This is the swag information included in the email: "Order your Sourcegraph swag pack! Use the link below to select your T-shirt and hoodie size, provide your shipping address, and place your order. one of the links below and fill out all required fields to order your package."

Once an order is placed, the new hire will get an email confirmation with delivery details. Sourcegraph covers the shipping cost, which varies depending on the shipping destination. We can view the shipping costs associated with recent orders in the invoices Telescope emails to PeopleOps/Finance.

## Promotion gifting

The People Team is currently working to develop a custom promotion gift, but in the meantime, we encourage Managers to [share the news broadly and recognize their teammates’ accomplishments!](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#promotions)

The People team and our vendor, Telescope, will be monitoring inventory to ensure we have necessary items in stock. Inventory production turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks.

**Reordering inventory**

The people team can view inventory levels in our [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/) and in the monthly inventory report sent via email from Telescope.

Telescope monitors the inventory levels and production timeframes of each item and will reach out via email for re-order approval at the necessary times to avoid running out of stock. We pay via invoice. Telescope emails all invoices to Finance and Kemper/Michal and Finance actions.

Best practice is to work with Telescope ahead of each Impact Review season to ensure we’re prepared for upcoming promotion gifting.

**How the People team sends Promotion Gifts**

For one-off promotions, gifts will be ordered by the People team through the [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/). Simply select 'Kits' from the menu bar, then select the Promotion kit, and checkout using the teammates' shipping addresses listed BambooHR.

To send promotion gifts in bulk, create a spreadsheet with each teammate's name, email, shipping address. Then, email the spreadsheet to chloe@telescopestudio.com and kyra@telescopestudio.com.

## New baby gifting

We currently offer [these items](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#new-babies) in our new baby gifts

The People team and our vendor, Telescope, will be monitoring inventory to ensure we have necessary items in stock. Inventory production turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks.

**Reordering inventory**

The people team can view inventory levels in our [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/) and in the monthly inventory report sent via email from Telescope.

The People team sends a new baby gift at the beginning of a teammates' parental leave. This gift will be ordered by the People team through the [Telescope Storefront](https://sourcegraph.telescopestudio.com/). Simply select 'Kits' from the menu bar, then select the Baby Kit, and checkout using the teammates' shipping addresses listed BambooHR.

## Work anniversary and birthday gifting

Managers are responsible for sending anniversary and birthday gifts to their teammates and the budget will come from the individual’s team budget. Our recommendation is for managers to use [Loop & Tie](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#loop--tie), which will be put onto a company card and then later reclassed into the correct team’s budget.

On the 1st of each month, the People team (Kemper) will send an email to finance@sourcegraph.com with a breakdown of what charges have been placed on the Loop & Tie card and which team’s to reclass the charges into.

**How we hold managers accountable for gifting**

Every Monday, Kemper sends a slack message to managers who have teammates with a birthday or anniversary in the upcoming week:

\_Hi [Manager Name]! Friendly reminder that it is [Teammate’s Name]’s [Birthday/Anniversary] on [Date].

_Please:_

- _Make a post in #thanks if you haven’t already (suggestions can be found here)_
- _[Order a Loop & Tie gift](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#loop--tie)_
- _Respond with a :white_check_mark: when both of the above actions are completed!_

## Additional Gifting/Swag

For any gifting/swag that is not on [this list](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#when-we-send-gifts-to-teammates), we use a vendor named [Telescope](https://www.telescopestudio.com/). In the event a teammate wants to order custom gifts for other occasions, such as a team trip or celebration, they will fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCBlGZA4HOEi3oh-uEQt2NaK9wh8qtWlVzfIAavkTJQQxz0w/viewform) to provide necessary information such as: the occasion, type of swag they want, delivery deadline, quantity, and countries for delivery.

**Note: The budget will be the responsibility of the team requesting the order - this must be confirmed prior to beginning the ordering process.
**

After the teammate has submitted the google form, the People team will start an email thread using the template below to connect the teammate with Telescope, who will facilitate the rest of the ordering process.

**Email Template:**
