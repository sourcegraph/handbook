# Compliance training - Internal use

As part of the Sourcegraph team, teammates are required to complete different compliance trainings. **All team members**, regardless of location, are required to take harassment prevention and security awareness training, and an annually roll re training of both of them. The training takes place in [Continu (LMS)](../tools/continu.md).

New hires complete the training as part of their onboarding within their first month at Sourcegraph.
All teammates re take trainings annually on a set date. _[April for Security Awareness and June for Preventing Harassment]_
New hires who joined within 6 months prior to the re training, don’t have to do the retraining that year. You can read more about it [here](../../../../company-info-and-process/working-at-sourcegraph/teammate-development/training/compliance/index.md)

### Exceptions

If a new hire is a re-hire (whether intern or otherwise) and previously completed a required training, they would only need to take it again if one of the following is true:

- We don’t have a way to connect their new employment record with their old one (such that we couldn’t prove it was them who took the training in the same way as other teammates); OR
- they took the training too long ago such that they would be due for re-training based on our training schedule; OR
- they need to take a different version of the training (such as someone who worked for us as an international teammate previously but is re-hired as a U.S. employee - they would have to take a different version of the harassment training and should be assigned that course).

This also applies for onboarded contractors who need to align with out training compliance policies.
