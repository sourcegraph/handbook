## How to create a profile

BambooHR profiles are created automatically when someone is marked as hired in Greenhouse via integration. However, here are the steps to create one manually:

### Creating a Job Title

This action is not always needed. We need to create a Job Title only when it is new to BambooHR.

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click on **Employee Fields**
3. **Job Title**
4. Write the new title on the field and click **Add**

## Creating a profile

On the Home page, click on New â†’ New Employee top right of the screen.

![Steps to creating a profile](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/PeopleTeam/BambooInternal/BambooStep2.png)

Complete as many of the fields possible. Look at the next section to know which fields we complete and how. Keep in mind that when creating a profile manually, the Options and Commission fields don't appear. You will need to go to the profile after it's been created to complete those missing fields.

## Profile Fields and how to complete them

Here are all the fields in a profile and how we must complete them:
