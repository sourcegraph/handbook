## How to create a profile

BambooHR profiles are created automatically when someone is marked as hired in Greenhouse via integration. However, here are the steps to create one manually:

### Creating a Job Title

This action is not always needed. We need to create a Job Title only when it is new to BambooHR.

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click on **Employee Fields**
3. **Job Title**
4. Write the new title on the field and click **Add**

## Creating a profile

On the Home page, click on New â†’ New Employee top right of the screen.

![Steps to creating a profile](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/PeopleTeam/BambooInternal/BambooStep2.png)

Complete as many of the fields possible. Look at the next section to know which fields we complete and how. Keep in mind that when creating a profile manually, the Options and Commission fields don't appear. You will need to go to the profile after it's been created to complete those missing fields.

## Profile Fields and how to complete them

Here are all the fields in a profile and how we must complete them:

## Editing a profile

There are different ways of editing a profile.

### Personal tab

All of these fields can be updated or edited by typing the new/correct information.

Once the changes are made, click on **Save changes** to make them effective.

Some of these fields can be edited by teammates. When they do, the People team receives a notification and have to approve the changes before they show in BambooHR.

### Job tab

Just like in the Personal tab, all free style and drop down fields can be updated/edited and we'll have to click on **Save changes** for them to be effective.

For Employment Status, Compensation, Job Information, Options, and Commission, there are two ways of changing the information:

**Editing**
To edit the information, put the cursor on the line you want to edit and click on the pencil. Make the changes and the line will be edited. The same applies for removing the line.

This _only_ applies for mistakes. We do not edit lines if something in the teammate's employment changes. When that's the case, we update by adding a new line.

![How to edit a field](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/PeopleTeam/BambooInternal/editing.png)

**Updating**
We update information by clicking on **+ Update XXX**. This will add a new line on top of the excisting ones. A good example of when we do this is when a teammate has a new manager o a change in compensation.

Keep in mind Effective Date refers to the day the change will be effective, not the date we are doing the update.

![How to edit a field](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/PeopleTeam/BambooInternal/updating.png)

## How to terminate someone

Go to the person's profile, and update Employment Status in the Job tab.

Complete the following fields:

- Effective Date (departure date/paythrough date)
- Employment Status: Terminated
- Termination Type: Voluntary/Involuntary/Mutal Separation
- Termination Reason
- Eligible for Rehire:
  - Yes:
    - No PIP
  - No
    - PIP
    - Any of these reasons [COMING SOON]

Under Employment Status, complete:

- Attrition Type:
  - Regrettable
  - Non-Regrettable

For managers with direct reports, confirm with terminated person's manager what the new reporting structure will be and update it in BambooHR. The report change should be effective after this person's last active day (System Deactivation Date/Last day), which may not necessarily be the same as departure date or last pay date.

### Rescinded offers/acceptances

If someone has signed their contract but will not be starting after all, we need to terminate them in BambooHR. The process is the same as explained above, however, we must add a note in the Employment Status comment section. This is what we state:

- If we rescinded the offer: "Offer rescinded"
- If the person decided not to join: "Withdrew acceptance before onboarding"

Keep in mind that the start date will be after the rescinding of the offer, therefore the start date will override the rescinding date. We will need to delete the start date entry.
