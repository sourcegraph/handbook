# Resources for People Team - Internal teammate gifting

This page is intended for internal People team use. It outlines when we gift internal teammates, how we send gifts, what gifts are sent, and who we partner with to fulfill our gifting initiatives.

## When we send gifts to teammates

The People team is responsible for sending gifts for:
- New hires
- Promotions
- New babies
- Company Offsites 

Managers are responsible for sending gifts for:
- Birthdays
- Work Anniversaries
- Team Accomplishments 

## Who we partner with to send gifts to teammates

- [Telescope](https://www.telescopestudio.com/) - New Hire Kits, Promotion gifts, New Parent gifts, and other miscellaneous internal gifting requests
- [Loop & Tie](https://www.loopandtie.com/) - Birthdays and Work Anniversaries 

## New hire gifting

We currently offer [these items](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#new-hire-kits) in our new hire gifts

The People team and our vendor, Telescope, will be monitoring inventory to ensure we have necessary items in stock. Inventory production turnaround time is typically 3-4 weeks.

## Promotion gifting
The People Team is currently working to develop a custom promotion gift, but in the meantime, we encourage Managers to [share the news broadly and recognize their teammates’ accomplishments!](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#promotions)

We offer these items in our promotion boxes:

## Work anniversary and birthday gifting
Managers are responsible for sending anniversary and birthday gifts to their teammates and the budget will come from the individual’s team budget. Our recommendation is for managers to use [Loop & Tie](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#loop--tie), which will be put onto a company card and then later reclassed into the correct team’s budget. 

On the 1st of each month, the People team (Kemper) will send an email to finance@sourcegraph.com with a breakdown of what charges have been placed on the Loop & Tie card and which team’s to reclass the charges into. 

**How we hold managers accountable for gifting**

Every Monday, Kemper sends a slack message to managers who have teammates with a birthday or anniversary in the upcoming week:

_Hi [Manager Name]! Friendly reminder that it is [Teammate’s Name]’s [Birthday/Anniversary] on [Date].

_Please:_

- _Make a post in #thanks if you haven’t already (suggestions can be found here)_
- _[Order a Loop & Tie gift](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#loop--tie)_
- _Respond with a :white_check_mark: when both of the above actions are completed!_


## Additional Gifting/Swag

For any gifting/swag that is not on [this list](../../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/celebrate.md#when-we-send-gifts-to-teammates), we use a vendor named [Telescope](https://www.telescopestudio.com/). In the event a teammate wants to order custom gifts for other occasions, such as a team trip or celebration, they will fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCBlGZA4HOEi3oh-uEQt2NaK9wh8qtWlVzfIAavkTJQQxz0w/viewform) to provide necessary information such as: the occasion, type of swag they want, delivery deadline, quantity, and countries for delivery.

**Note: The budget will be the responsibility of the team requesting the order - this must be confirmed prior to beginning the ordering process.
**

After the teammate has submitted the google form, the People team will start an email thread using the template below to connect the teammate with Telescope, who will facilitate the rest of the ordering process.

**Email Template:**

Hi Telescope team,

I’d like you to meet [insert teammate’s name]. They would like to begin a custom swag order. Details are provided below. Please let [insert teammate’s name] know what other information you need to get started.

Occasion:

- Type of swag (ex: hats, backpacks, etc.)
- Custom design request(s)
- Delivery deadline

Thank you!
