# Internal Offboarding Process

This page outlines the process our internal teams complete once a teammate has let their manager and the People team know they are leaving Sourcegraph.

## Offboarding checklist

We track offboarding tasks by creating a Process St checklist for each departing teammate. The departing teammate's People partner will create the teammate's offboarding checklist. These checklists are for internal use only, the teammate does not need to complete any Process St. tasks.

People Ops, Payroll, Tech Ops, and Security use the checklist to track the following offboarding tasks.

### Internal Team Tasks

- Announcing the teammates' departure
  - Within 24 hours of notice, announce the teammates' departure in #manager-team, following our [announcement protocol](../../../../company-info-and-process/communication/announcements.md#departures)
  - Once that's done, the manager will notify their team

The full People team offboarding process can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13dkDp2P-f1GGotxONdObB918TybxYFDK4t6N0avcpPo/edit#). It details the Peple Team's process step by step and outlines any offboarding variations for each employment type (Temporary contractors, PEO, US employee).

Prior to the teammates last day, the People Partner is responsible for:

- Scheduling the teammate's profile termination in BambooHR.
- Updating the BambooHR reporting structure (if the departing teammate is a people manager)
- Sending the departing teammate an email with offboarding information/instructions
- Sending the departing teammate a severance agreement via docusign (if applicable)
  - See 'How we send severance agreements' below for details

- Scheduling and complete an exit interview with the departing teammate

As soon as the People Partner confirms the manager has communicated the upcoming departure to the manager Slack channel and to their team, the People Ops team is responsible for:

On the teammates' final working day, the People Ops team is responsible for:

- Triggering the #announce-teammate-departures notification
- Removing any mentions of the departing teammate from the handbook and replace their name with the updated contact name.
- Removing the departing teammates' LinkedIn Recruiter License has been parked (if applicable)

##### How we send severance agreements

- If the teammates' departure involves severance, the People Partner will create a severance agreement for the teammate and send it via Docusign.
  We send these agreements via the People-ops@sourcegraph.com Docusign account using the Severance Agreement Docusign template. Once the People Partner and the departing teammate have signed the agreement, Payroll is sent a cc copy.

##**Unemployment Claims**
We respond to all unemployment claims that require action to be taken. The full internal people team process can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d1lfumDP0RKFxchc7kvMPMhyN4984d2KFYVSZIXzlEY/edit?usp=sharing).
