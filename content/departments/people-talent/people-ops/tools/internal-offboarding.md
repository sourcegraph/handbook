# Internal Offboarding Process

This page outlines the process our internal teams complete once a teammate has let their manager and the People team know they are leaving Sourcegraph.

## Severance agreements

If the teammates' departure involves severance, the People Partner will create a severance agreement for the teammate and send it via Docusign.
We send these agreements via the People-ops@sourcegraph.com Docusign account using the Severance Agreement Docusign template. Once the People Partner and the departing teammate have signed the agreement, Payroll is sent a cc copy.

## Offboarding checklist

The departing teammate's People partner will create the teammate's offboarding checklist in Process St. These checklists are for internal use only, the teammate does not need to complete any Process St. tasks.

People Ops, Payroll, Tech Ops, and Security use the checklist to track the following offboarding tasks.
