# Internal Onboarding Process

## Pre onboarding

This process occurs prior to a new teammate’s first day, as we set them up for joining Sourcegraph.

### After accepting the offer

Once someone accepts the offer and signs the contract, the Talent team marks them as hired. This creates the profile in BambooHR and sends a **Greenhouse summary email** to onboarding@sourcegraph.com

This email contains all relevant information that we need to complete the person's [BambooHR profile](bamboohr.md#how-to-create-a-profile) and fill the Teammate tracking sheet.

**Step 1: Teammate Tracking Spreadsheet**
  - In order to make sure we are using the correct and most updated data we use the [Teammate tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qt3rGNRVaSyi_N2uN3DaXvlg8LjfKLJb8PFfrQsmR-I/edit?ts=6007152c#gid=460686311). Even though the source of truth is _always_ BambooHR, it is an easy way to keep track on what we have and are missing. Once we receive the Greenhouse summary email, we need to add a line for the person joining with the information needed.

**Step 2: Upload signed document to the contracts folder**

**Step 3: Complete BambooHR Profile**
Make sure the person's profile exists and is complete. See the [BambooHR profile section](bamboohr.md#how-to-create-a-profile).

The two most important fields are the "Work email" and the "Timezone TZ". Via the Okta integration, the email will be created using the value written in the "Work email" field (make sure to follow preferredname.preferredsurname@sourcegraph.com convention); and Okta access will be sent to the new hire considering their timezone.

On the personal tab, complete only these fields:
- Name: Make sure the full legal name is in BambooHR
- Timezone TZ: Select the teammate’s timezone. This is one of the most important fields to complete because Okta activation for new teammates is scheduled based on this Timezone field. 
- Region: Select the teammate’s region
- Work Email: Completed by People team later in the onboarding process. Leave blank for now.
- Personal email: Integrated via Greenhouse. If not, manually entered by People team

On the job tab, complete only these fields

If the new teammate will be a people manager, confirm with the HM who the new teammate’s direct reports will be, and update their BambooHR profiles accordingly
- Click ‘+Update Job Information’, select the new managers’ start date, enter the new managers’ name in, leave all other fields as-is, click ‘Save’.

**Step 4: Send BambooHR Onboarding Kit**
1. Open the new teammate’s BambooHR Profile, select the ‘More’ tab, then select ‘Onboarding’. 
2. Click the ‘Create New Hire Packet’ button, then select the appropriate template (based on the new teammate’s location - US or non-US). The information should auto-populate and the Location field should be the only one left blank, since we’re remote. 
3. Import the onboarding kit tasks: ordering swag, submitting your new hire video and photo for avatar, completing your background check, and filling out your BambooHR profile
4. Select ‘Preview and send’, review the information and select ‘Continue’ through the packet. When ready, click ‘Send New Hire Packet’. 

**Step 5: Create Avatar**

After the offer letter is signed, new hires will email a photo to people-ops@sourcegraph.com. We turn that photo into their avatar and add the original photo + avatar photo to [this avatar folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1T5qaSLjE2UbG0yt52gb3IVIGOUYm_YKA).

**Step 6: Run Process St. onboarding checklists**
Both the Universal Workflow and Department Specific Workflow need to be run.
(PROCESS COMING SOON)

**Step 7: Complete the Teammate's information 👤**

This must be done on both the Universal and Department Specific Workflow.
Once this section has been marked ‘Complete’, two automated slack messages will be sent

If the teammate will be located in the US, the Payroll Communication task will be visible. Under Payroll Communication, ensure the teammate’s name, start date, and work email are correct, then click Click on Complete Task. 

**Step 8: Begin the _People Ops - before day 1_ section of the onboarding checklist**
Complete all tasks that are marked as ‘prior to the teammate's work email being created’ and mark them as ‘Complete’ in Process St.

**Step 9: Confirm Manager completed the Process St tasks assigned to them**

The People Ops team will check Process Street on the Thursday before each cohort start date to confirm if Hiring Managers have completed their onboarding tasks. If the information is not complete, People Ops will slack each manager directly to remind them to complete the information ASAP so their new hire will be ready for their first day.

### Once Sourcegraph email is created
The rest of the onboarding tasks can only be completed after the person's work email has been created. This happens automatically through the Okta/BambooHR integration 5 days (the Wednesday) before someone starts. The integration runs daily, so if someone is added to BambooHR after that, the user will still be created. We can also manually run the integration if needed. You should contact Tech Ops for this.

**Step 10: Notify the company**
Send a message to #announce-new-teammates letting everyone know that a new teammate is joining and that their emails are now live. The sooner we do this the better.  Combine this message for any other teammates in the same onboarding cohort.

**Step 11: Add to relevant calendar meetings**
Here are the events we must manually invite the new teammate to
- 1 Month Check In - 15 min meeting with Kemper on each new teammate’s 1 month mark
- Meet the Founders (just once)
- Meet the People Team  (just once)
- Meet & Greet (just once) 

Tech Ops will add each new hire to Google Groups, which will automatically add them to other company and team specific events. 

**Step 12: Schedule the First Day Prep email**
The Friday before a new hire’s start date, we send an email in the Welcome email thread started by the recruiter when they were hired. You can see the email template in the [onboarding email templates doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kX_6c4WPs530pWjAx7R5MGPFGiYCgmVbh78S-K3kHfc/edit#). 

**Step 13: Schedule the 3 month Onboarding Survey slack message**
Surveys are conducted at the 3-month mark to collect feedback from all new teammates to make sure that their onboarding experience is properly equipping them with the support and resources necessary for them to be successful in their new role. [Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fm46VUs2CWCABXvVxYR2n7J24BV5Nt1v9ahK_4qqjEc/edit) is the survey.

Step 14: Update BambooHR settings 
Open the new teammate’s BambooHR profile, click Settings, hover over ‘BambooHR Access Level’, then select ‘Everyone’. If the teammate is a People Manager, select ‘Managers’
- Do not do this before the new hire’s email address has been created
- You need full admin access in BambooHR to complete this step. The People team can grant this access if needed.

**Step 15: Assign Compliance training in Continu**
Create user in Continu. Go to Admin → Users → Add User. Complete all fields except for Language and Level
- Groups: It is important you add teammates to the correct groups. We use groups to create rules that assign courses. One person can be in more than one group, if that’s the case, please include all of them. These are the current groups:
  - Manager
  - Individual Contributor
  - International
  - People Ops

Automatically assigned trainings:
- The Security Awareness training is assigned to everyone automatically. 
- Preventing Harrassment and Discrimination training is assigned by rules based on location and role. All international teammates go through the “International” training. US teammates will be assigned a training based on role (IC or Manager) and state. Certain states have specific versions of the trainin, so it is important we add teammates to the correct Groups as the rule will check groups and state.

**Step 16: Complete the People Ops - before day 1 section of the onboarding checklist**
Confirm ALL People Ops - before day 1 tasks are marked as complete in Process St.

**Step 17: ‘Hide rows’ in Teammate Tracking Spreadsheet**
Now that the tasks are completed, hide the teammate's row in the tracking spreadsheet, but don’t delete it in case we need to reference the data in the future. 

### Once the teammate has joined Sourcegraph

**Step 18: I9 and E-verify**

#### How our teammates use Workbright - US teammates only

On US teammates' first day at Sourcegraph, they will receive an email from WorkBright that includes all instructions on how to complete the I9 via their mobile phone. Through Workbright, new hires will join a video meeting to fill out the I-9 form in-person alongside an authorized representative.

Workbright Tutorial Videos can be found [here](https://workbrightsupport.com/videos/).

Please let #ask-people-team or people-ops@sourcegraph.com know if you have any questions!

#### How the People Ops team uses Workbright

Setting Up Users

1. On each new hire’s first day at Sourcegraph, log into [Workbright](https://sourcegraph.workbright.com/) and select ‘Add Staff Member’
2. Select the Employee Type - Employee/W-2 (W-4 & I-9)
3. Fill in the employee’s personal Email and Legal Name
4. Click ‘Next’
5. Leave the custom field checkbox blank and click ‘Next’
6. Leave the groups field blank and click ‘Next’
7. Insert the teammate’s start date and click ‘Send Notifications Now’
8. Remote Verification should be toggled ON
9. Click ‘Finish’

Steps to complete E-verify can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BWouWHj3WAlglyt7ZunnjMlev4XnFzTuVcUoa95LNnc/edit#heading=h.f31huogsqa18)

## Onboarding Feedback

There are two main onboarding feedback instances:

- **One Month check in**: 15 min check-in with a People Ops team member to get a pulse check, ask Teammates how they are doing and feeling, whether they are clear about expectations & ensure they are adapting well to asynchronous work, and get feedback on the onboarding process.
- **Onboarding survey**: sent out monthly on the three month mark. Based on the [standards of success](../../../../company-info-and-process/onboarding/index.md#onboarding-standards-and-success) the teammate’s survey is focused on experience, content, and format, and presentation.

### Onboarding survey

Surveys are conducted at the 3-month mark to collect feedback from all new teammates to make sure that their onboarding experience is properly equipping them with the support and resources necessary for them to be successful in their new role.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fm46VUs2CWCABXvVxYR2n7J24BV5Nt1v9ahK_4qqjEc/edit) is the survey.

On the last Monday of each month, we send a Slack message to each person asking them to complete the survey. Here is an example of the message:

_Hey! Hope you are doing great!_

_One of my biggest projects at the moment is making the onboarding process as rich and structured as possible, so as to build every new teammate up for success. To do this, I constantly meet with new hires, managers, and teammates to listen to their feedback and experience._
_This time, I wanted to listen to your input in this. I’ve created a **[survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fm46VUs2CWCABXvVxYR2n7J24BV5Nt1v9ahK_4qqjEc/edit)** to collect feedback from all teammates that have been with us since [MONTH] to ask if their onboarding experience has properly equipping you with the support and resources necessary for you to be successful in your new role._
_It is a simple survey, most of the questions are multiple choice and some require some input. Would you mind taking 10 minutes to complete it? :pray:_
_Could you please submit it by XXX?_
_Thank you! Have a great day :)_

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UVfc47SEhH_DhvqMvA9iYDVhCjnynDiJI_5GcsnwU_4/edit?usp=sharing) you can find dashboards with the onboarding survey results.

## Transition onboarding

When someone changes teams, we make sure they have access to the resources needed to be successful in their new role. We provide teammates a Process St. checklist. You can read more about internal mobility [here](../../../../company-info-and-process/working-at-sourcegraph/switching-teams.md). Once the People team is notified, we run a checklist from the Transition Onboarding workflows, share it with the manager and send it to the teammate on the day the role change is effective.

The most comment transitions are:

- [SDR to AE](../../../sales/sdrteam/index.md#sdr-promotion-process)
- [Aplication Engineer to Engineer]

## Temporary Contractor onboarding

## Start date change

#### Request

Because this is a process that involves a lot of teams, when asking for someone to start earlier, the requests must be sent at least 5 business days before the new starts date.

If someone needs to postpone their start date, we need to know as soon as possible to stop the preonboarding cycle in the backend.

If the teammate needs to change a start date, the recruiter must follow the instructions in [this handbook page](../../talent/process/after_the_offer.md#changing-a-new-hires-start-date).

If Hiring Managers need to bring forward a start date, they need to request for the change at least 5 business days before the new starts date.

If someone needs to start _outside of a cohort date_ the recruiter and Hiring Manager need to talk to Tech Ops, Payroll and Onboarding. They must provide a valid business case for it.

_It is important to always confirm these changes with the Hiring Manager before and after accepting the change_

#### Change updates

We must notify the manager and update the start date in BambooHR. This is critical.

Once that's done, change the start date in the [Teammate tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qt3rGNRVaSyi_N2uN3DaXvlg8LjfKLJb8PFfrQsmR-I/edit?ts=6007152c#gid=460686311).

## Rescinding offer

When someone rescinds their offer, the Onboarding team needs to be informed as soon as possible. Considering onboarding involves many moving parts and teams, time is of the esense. The Onboarding team will notify Payroll, Tech Ops, the managers, and anyone else involved in the process.

We also need to deactivate the user in BambooHR. Go to [this page](bamboohr.md#rescinded-offersacceptances) to follow the steps in BambooHR.
