# E-Verify

US law requires companies to employ only individuals who may legally work in the US.

[E-Verify](https://www.e-verify.gov/) is a web-based system that allows Sourcegraph to confirm the eligibility of US-based individuals to work in the US. We will not use E-Verify for anyone who is not located in the US.
