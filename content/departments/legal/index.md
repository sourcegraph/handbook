# Legal

Our mission is to accelerate Sourcegraph's growth through legal strategy.

We provide high-quality legal advice to every team. High-quality legal advice at Sourcegraph is:

- **Practical** - enables teams to make decisions
- **Efficient** - timely and avoids being a bottleneck or slowing down decisions
- **Balanced** - given in context and considers priorities, differing viewpoints, and competing interests

We manage the company's legal risk by anticipating major legal risks and building mitigation plans. Legal risk includes lawsuits and investigations brought by a third party, which can be a customer, competitor, user, teammate, partner, vendor, or regulator. We enable teammates to identify and weigh legal risks, make informed decisions, and accept calculated risks.

We take initiatives that improve all teammates’ experiences working with the legal team.

### Legal checklist for product marketing

When to engage legal:

1. [Product inception, pre-beta launches, and launches](../product/process/gtm/new_feature_legal_questionnaire.md)
1. [Naming new products, features, and programs](../marketing/product-marketing/naming_guide.md)
1. Feature deprecation or other changes (see Product inception link above) that may affect ToS or Privacy Policy

### Legal checklist for contract review

Every redline is a cost to the company. Redlines cost company resources and slow deal cycles and revenue growth. Given that, we only make redlines that create useful benefits or reduce actual risks for the company. Check your redlines against the redline priorities outlined below:

1. Limit company liability for data breaches and other common existential lawsuits
1. Retain company IP
1. Protect revenue from churn or other reductions (termination for convenience, warranties, cure periods, international tax)
1. Remove unnecessary obligations that we don't have in place (reporting obligations, customer-specific SLAs)

## Policy updates

### Privacy policy

At least annually, with regular monitoring throughout the year, Legal assesses the need for updates to our [Privacy policy](https://about.sourcegraph.com/privacy), to reflect changes in applicable laws and our data collection, use, storage, and sharing practices. Legal will loop relevant stakeholders into this process.

**Have a Privacy policy update?** Want to document a change in data collection, use, or sharing?

- Add your proposed update in “suggest change” mode on this [staging version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dXLuK8sYyZiqpG8iADEgXWqDRtzlkPDgbJAe1jb1Ff0/edit#) and tag our privacy counsel in a comment.
