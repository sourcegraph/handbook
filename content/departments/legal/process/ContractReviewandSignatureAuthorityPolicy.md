# Contract review and signature authority policy

Effective and last modified April 21, 2022

The purpose of this policy is to help you direct your contracts to the right team or teammate to review, approve, and sign.

This policy covers the following types of contracts:

1. NDAs
1. Customer contracts
1. Vendor contracts
1. Partner contracts

If you are not sure where to direct a contract for review, approval, or signature, you can reach out to the legal team.

## How to submit requests for review

Legal:

- [legal@sourcegraph.com](mailto:legal@sourcegraph.com)
- For general legal requests or questions, please use the #legal slack channel.
- For Customer contracts, please submit request via the #deal-desk slack channel.
- For Vendor contracts, please submit requests via the #vendor-requests slack channel.

Give us about 1 business day to acknowledge receipt and give you an estimated turnaround time. If you don’t hear back from us in about 1 business day, follow up to make sure we saw your request. If your request is time-sensitive, let us know the ideal turnaround time.

Deal Desk:

- [dealdesk@sourcegraph.com](mailto:dealdesk@sourcegraph.com)
- For Customer Contracts (OF, MSA and other approvals), please submit requests via the #deal-desk slack channel.
- For process guidance or deal structuring information, please use the #deal-desk channel or contact us through email.

Finance:

- [finance@sourcegraph.com](mailto:finance@sourcegraph.com) or
- For general finance requests or questions, please use the #finance slack channel.
- For Customer contracts, please submit request via the #deal-desk slack channel.
- For Vendor Contracts, please submit requests via the #vendor-requests slack channel.

If you submit a request via #legal or #finance slack channels, no need to duplicate your request in each channel. You can just post your request in one channel and tag the other team.

## What to do when the contract is fully signed

Save a copy of the fully signed contract in (1) the appropriate **Google Drive** folder and (2) **Salesforce** (for customer contracts):

- [NDAs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kwsephGh0quiOIgvLBE_XU3DEfe97Z78) as Party Name-NDA-Year-Month-Date
- [Customer contracts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ePvVWcZYdd1_3ZlCP5A0lvMbBhBCVfSm) as Year-Month-Date-Customer-Contract Name
- [Suppliers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hO7wFuvix3QcIDgM6OLNyjfElOUv-s0k) as Year-Month-Date-Vendor-Contract Name
- [Partner contracts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cl3B560wT85Zj4crlvZ7ngRoHCTqdn6q) as Year-Month-Date-Partner-Contract Name

For example, save customer contracts as 2021-06-21 Customer-OF and MSA. Save NDAs as Customer-NDA-2021-06-21.

For click-through agreements, forward confirmation emails to legal@sourcegraph.com. If none, then email legal@sourcegraph.com confirming that you accepted the click-through terms.

For Salesforce, complete the opportunity with the following steps: 1) go to the opportunity and click on the "Files" link near the top of the page. On the far right of the "Files" page is "Add Files". 2) Go back to the opportunity and at the top right click the "Add Products" link. Fill out the info in the link and pay attention to the monthly/yearly period options so that they are consistent. 3) Go back to the opportunity and complete the other fields in the opportunity as follows: switch the Stage to "7 - Closed Won"; next scroll down to the "Financial Details" and "Opportunity Close Out" sections and add the appropriate "ACV", "Closed Won Reason", "Start of Contract" and "End of Contract". Save and you should be done.

### Legal Review Workflow for Vendor Contracts:

- Is legal review necessary?
  - If (1) no personal data or sensitive data and (2) annual contract spend is projected to be <$100,000 per year, no legal review.
- Does the vendor access, collect, or receive any customer data (including customer code, repo names, pings or personal data of customer personnel)?
  - Get a DPA
  - Flag to legal@sourcegraph.com or the #legal Slack channel to update the subprocessor list and notify customers who have signed up for updates of new subprocessor
- Does the vendor access, collect, or receive any personal data of Sourcegraph personnel (for example, will our teammates create an account to log in)?
  - Personal data typically includes usernames or email addresses, but can also include any other information that can be used to identify an individual: name, title, personal address, location data, physical characteristics, etc.
  - Get a DPA
- Does the vendor access one of the following types of sensitive data?
  - Sensitive security information (e.g. incident data, security logs, authentication)
  - Core IT infrastructure (e.g. GCP, AWS, customer data storage)
- IF ANY OF THE ABOVE, legal to review and negotiate
  - Indemnification for data breach/confidentiality breach
  - Uncapped liability for indemnification
  - Sample language is available in our [Vendor Review Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RxuOmvrw8Khe7sbMoNcFkrASoTdh4a0MsqWrg4FWqpw/edit)
- Examples of contract types that generally do not require legal review
  - One-off team trainings that do not involve the provision of personal data
  - Events and conferences
  - Hotels

- We don’t have Sourcegraph forms for partner contracts yet
- Partner Form (including online click-through agreements)
  - Review: Legal
  - Approve: VP and Finance
