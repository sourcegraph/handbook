# Contract review and signature authority policy

Effective and last modified June 21, 2021

The purpose of this policy is to help you direct your contracts to the right team or teammate to review, approve, and sign.

This policy covers the following types of contracts:

1. NDAs
1. Customer contracts
1. Vendor contracts
1. Partner contracts

If you are not sure where to direct a contract for review, approval, or signature, you can reach out to the legal team.

## How to submit requests for review

Legal:

- [legal@sourcegraph.com](mailto:legal@sourcegraph.com) or
- #legal slack channel

Give us about 1 business day to acknowledge receipt and give you an estimated turnaround time. If you don’t hear back from us in about 1 business day, follow up to make sure we saw your request. If your request is time-sensitive, let us know the ideal turnaround time.

Finance:

- [finance@sourcegraph.com](mailto:finance@sourcegraph.com) or
- #finance slack channel

If you submit a request via #legal or #finance slack channels, no need to duplicate your request in each channel. You can just post your request in one channel and tag the other team.

## What to do when the contract is fully signed

Save a copy of the fully signed contract in (1) the appropriate **Google Drive** folder and (2) **Salesforce** (for customer contracts):

- [NDAs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kwsephGh0quiOIgvLBE_XU3DEfe97Z78) as Party Name-NDA-Year-Month-Date
- [Customer contracts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ePvVWcZYdd1_3ZlCP5A0lvMbBhBCVfSm) as Year-Month-Date-Customer-Contract Name
- [Suppliers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hO7wFuvix3QcIDgM6OLNyjfElOUv-s0k) as Year-Month-Date-Vendor-Contract Name
- [Partner contracts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cl3B560wT85Zj4crlvZ7ngRoHCTqdn6q) as Year-Month-Date-Partner-Contract Name

For example, save customer contracts as 2021-06-21 Customer-OF and MSA. Save NDAs as Customer-NDA-2021-06-21.

For click-through agreements, forward confirmation emails to legal@sourcegraph.com. If none, then email legal@sourcegraph.com confirming that you accepted the click-through terms.

For Salesforce, complete the opportunity with the following steps: 1) go to the opportunity and click on the "Files" link near the top of the page. On the far right of the "Files" page is "Add Files". 2) Go back to the opportunity and at the top right click the "Add Products" link. Fill out the info in the link and pay attention to the monthly/yearly period options so that they are consistent. 3) Go back to the opportunity and complete the other fields in the opportunity as follows: switch the Stage to "7 - Closed Won"; next scroll down to the "Financial Details" and "Opportunity Close Out" sections and add the appropriate "ACV", "Closed Won Reason", "Start of Contract" and "End of Contract". Save and you should be done.
