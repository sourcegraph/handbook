# Support Team Schedule

Being an [all-remote](../../../company-info-and-process/remote/index.md) company means that we can choose to work when we want. This is absolutely true for CS and it is also a little more complicated for us. We have to coordinate a little more so we can honor our [service level agreements (SLAs)](../index.md#our-service-level-agreements-slas).

This starts by everyone on the team identifying their ideal working hours. If we have good coverage, we are set! If we have gaps, we work together to figure out a solution.

Our schedule also makes it clear when folks on the team have dedicated heads-down focus time. Working out of a queue can be tiresome and to keep the team engaged and able to continuously grow, when each team member reaches 90 days, they choose a focus day. On their focus day, it's up to each person how they spend that time. They can work on their tickets, they can learn something, they can work on a project, they can rest -- everyone maintains their own agency in what they decide to do. And if ever it feels hard to do the thing someone wants, bring that to your manager and we can sort it out.

We list pacific hours here in support of our contractual SLAs being listed in pacific hours.

We also hold Friday as a team-wide focus day. Friday is our slowest day and we can remain responsive to customers while also granting space for folks to spend time on other things, however they see fit.

Fridays are covered in 3 time blocks:

| Time block (in SLA hours Pacific hours) | Person covering | Local hours for the person covering | UTC hours   |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 2am-7am                                 | Mariam          | 10am-3pm                            | 10:00-15:00 |
| 7am-12pm                                | Don             | 10am-3pm                            | 15:00-20:00 |
| 12pm-5pm                                | Kelvin          | 12pm-5pm                            | 20:00-01:00 |

Mariam also covers triage during the first time block. Brielle, Sarah, Shawnteé, and Virginia rotate who covers triage during the rest of the day (reflected each week on the team calendar).

When those covering Friday need time off and/or when those observing the focus day need anyone to fill-in, we follow the guidance written in our [rituals](../team-culture/index.md).

When new folks join the team, they participate in the Friday focus day until their 90 day milestone, at which time they decide if they would like to shift to a non-Friday focus day and help cover Friday for the rest of the team.

## Adjusting the schedule

- **Ad-hoc adjustments** can be shared in the team Slack channel (#customer-support-internal) following the guidance written in our [rituals](../team-culture/index.md).
- **Lasting adjustments** can be discussed in in the team Slack channel (#customer-support-internal) or weekly 1:1s with your direct manager.

If an adjustment creates a gap in covering our SLAs, we will figure it out!
