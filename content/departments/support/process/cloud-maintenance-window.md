# Cloud Maintenance Window Process

From time to time we will need to run a production change on Sourcegraph Cloud that requires downtime, affecting paying and trial Cloud customers. This section covers how to successfully manage communications in these types of situations.

Note: These planned maintenance windows do not impact Self-Hosted Sourcegraph customers.

## Process
 1. Once a maintenance window with downtime has been scheduled, reach out to [Virginia Ulrich](mailto:virginia@sourcegraph.com) (support), [Alex Isken](mailto:alex.isken@sourcegraph.com) (PMM for Cloud), and [Ryan Phillips](mailto:ryphil@sourcegraph.com) (PM for Cloud). By this time, you should have an idea of:
	- The time, date, and duration of the planned outage
	- The impact on the experience for customers (i.e. “New changes to repositories will not be represented during this time)
	- The breadth of impact (all customers or a subset of customers)
2. Using the above information, marketing and support will draft an email for customer communications. An example of this is provided below.
3. **Two weeks before** the maintenance window:
	- Support will notify customer engineers via #ce Slack Channel that a maintenance window with downtime will occur. At this point, each customer engineer is responsible for notifying individual customers via the mode of communication most relevant for that customer.
	- Support adds a maintenance window notification to [Sourcegraph Cloud’s status page](https://sourcegraphstatus.com/#).
	- The responsible engineering team nominates a point of contact to coordinate with support and CE.
4. **One Week Before:** Remind customers about the upcoming maintenance window 1 week, 3 days and 1 day before the change time via
5. On the day of the maintenance window: Support updates [Sourcegraph Cloud’s status page](https://sourcegraphstatus.com/#) to reflect the downtime
6. Upon completion of the maintenance:
	- The engineering point of contact will update the support team when the maintenance is complete and systems are operational.
	- Support will update the status page and notify Customer Engineering via #ce slack channel.
	- Each customer engineer will communicate the maintenance completion to customers via the appropriate communication channels.
