## View on customer support

Communication is key! I like to know as much as I can about the problem so that I can do my best to solve it. This leads to efficient problem-solving and leaves the customer feeling like they can trust me to help them again in the future.

## Preferred learning style

I'm definitely more of a hands-on learner but I also like to take time to research and learn about the topic on my own, through reading documentation and watching videos.

## Communication style

I prefer written communication (Slack DMs, email, etc).

## Collaboration style

I work best in one-on-one situations or in _small_ groups, preferably over Zoom because I like to be "face to face".

## Approach to problems

I like to start by gathering as much information as I think I'll need. The goal is to learn about the nature of the problem so that I can assess where I need to go from there. From this point, I would look into whether I've faced similar problems in the past (and how they were resolved) or do research if it's totally unfamiliar to me.

## Preferred way to be recognized

I have no strong preferences here, but I like being recognized.

## What I enjoy at work

I am big on personal growth so I really appreciate when there are opportunities for mentorship and for learning from those around me.

## Thoughts on asking for help

A lot of times asking for help is the only way to solve certain problems but I like to try things myself first. I feel more secure asking for help when I can say I've already tried xyz as a solution.

## Preferred time to work

I like to stick to a 9-5 work schedule. This gives me enough time in the morning to fully wake up and some time at the end of the day for non-work fun.

## Feelings to receiving messages outside work hours

I don't mind being messaged or emailed outside of work hours but it's unlikely that I would respond immediately to anything that isn't urgent. I have my work email and Slack on my phone just in case but in general I like the idea of not being reachable 24/7.

## How to show up when I'm feeling off

I like to take a moment to breathe and take a walk outside if I can spare some time.

## Things that make me anxious

Poor communication, whether in the form of no response to questions or incomplete expectations.
