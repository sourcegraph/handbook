# Sarah README

### My view on customer support

Always look for a path forward. My goal is to leave a customer/client/teammate feeling good after an interaction even if I haven’t yet solved their problem. I try to set myself in their shoes and look outward, which often helps me with my decision making.

### Preferred learning styles

Hands on with lots of questions.

### Communication style

I’m pretty straightforward and love to ask questions. It thats not your style, I can adjust to what works for you.

### Preferred way to collaborate

As long as it's an organized collaboration, I’m good with any approach.

### How I approach problems

I like to figure out how quickly the problem needs to be solved and go from there. Is it urgent? Who else should be involved? Define the end goal, find the resources, create a plan and execute. That said, it really depends on the problem that needs to be solved.

### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

I don’t have any preference, but always love positive feedback! A 'thank you' goes a long way with me.

### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

Oh this is a big goal of mine. I’m often uncomfortable asking for help, but constantly challenging myself to do so. If I am asking for help, it’s likely that I really need it and have exhausted all other avenues.

### What I find enjoyable at work

People, solving problems, contributing to the team, predicting and solving problems before they happen, mentorship, learning, and growth.

### What kind of work do I find easiest to do when

Admin stuff in the morning - I love to check things off my list first thing. An after lunch meeting is great to get me back to work.

### How do I feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for me to see and respond to during active hours

Totally fine. I have pretty healthy boundaries with unplugging when I am not “at work”, so don’t expect a response until I am back.

### How folks can best show up for me when I seem off

A private message to check in would probably be most helpful

### Things I am aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

Undefined expecations, poor communication, lack of empathy, knowing we can do better but not striving to.

### Technical areas of interest to learn

To be determined! I love to be a student.

### Current personal project

Converting our guest room into my new office. Come spring it will be my garden. Come summer it will be my tan.

### Something I fear

Failing. But I fear not trying more.

### A quote I like

"Damn the man. Save the Empire." - Mark, Empire Records

### How I eat fries

With ketchup and black pepper

### My sun, moon, and rising signs

Pisces sun, Leo moon, Taurus rising (Thanks, Co-Star!)
