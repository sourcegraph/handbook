#### Individual view on customer service/support

Support work is one of the most challenging (and sometimes least appreciated) place to be because it combines both technical, communication, and personal challenges. It's often not as simple as solving a problem because there are so many aspects to consider.

#### Preferred learning styles

Learning by doing > Doing then asking questions and/or reading/videos

#### Communication style

I appreciate honesty presented in a nice way, and I'll try to do the same.

#### Preferred way to collaborate

Live collaboration time in a psychologically safe space where folks are free to share ideas.

#### How you approach problems

It depends. In general I look for the most likely cause first (human error) to the least likely (defect). I assume that things are working properly until proven otherwise. For instance, something may be throwing an error because it's not configured right, not that it is inherently broken.

#### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

Copious amounts of sappy and happy crying emoji's in a slack thread.

#### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

I have no qualms admitting what I don't know. Likewise, if you need help with something, feel free to ask! I won't judge.

#### What you find enjoyable at work

Taking things that are otherwise messy and making them better. Seeing the results of hard work paying off. On point slack emoji's and giphy's.

#### What kind of work do you find easiest to do when (for example, some folks write best at night or can focus more easily in the afternoon)

It's easier for me to concentrate in the late morning, early afternoon, and at night when it's quiet.

#### How do you feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for you to see and respond to during active hours

Doesn't bother me! I normally have slack notifications turned off on my phone so don't expect a reply until work hours.

#### How folks can best show up for us when we seem off (give space, ask if work is the right place for us to be today, etc)

Humor! I don't want to dwell on bad feelings so I appreciate silliness that lightens the mood.

I also appreciate people being understanding that sometimes things aren't great and it may have nothing to do with work, then giving me time to come around.

#### Things you are aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

Interpersonal conflict.

#### Technical areas of knowledge

All the things.

#### Technical areas of interest to learn

Anything! I like listening to people share topics they are excited about.

#### Current personal project

Slowly working on a post bachelor's degree in Computer science. I'll get there someday!

#### Something you fear

My washing machine breaking.

#### A quote you like

> _"I think I can, I think I can, I think I can."_

The Little Engine that Could

#### How you eat fries (with or without ketchup (ketchup on the fries or on the side), etc)

Plain! Don't @ me.

#### Your sun, moon, and rising signs

_Looks suspiciously_.... You're trying to steal my secrets, aren't you?
