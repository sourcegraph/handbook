## View on customer support

Customer support is an important department that helps in establishing the product and generating revenue. If you can think like customer half of the battle is won , also good communication and working on feedbacks is important for high quality support.

## Preferred learning style

I prefer learning while working , I am more into practical learning than theory.

## Communication style

I prefer written communication (Slack DMs, email, etc).

## Collaboration style

I prefer working in small groups or one-one chats or face to face video calls over texts for lengthy discussions.

## Approach to problems

I read the problem statement carefully and pay attention to keywords, try to debug and figure out solution using my experience/expertise but if it’s a completely new topic I use different internal/external channels like going through Stack overflow, case history or reaching out to someone who might know it and set me on right path for troubleshooting.

## Preferred way to be recognized

I believe appreciation for good work keeps you motivated.

## What I enjoy at work

Learning from teammates and customers while working on different issues and also knowing different people and their thoughts on variety of topics.

## Thoughts on asking for help

I think asking for help should be encouraged , it saves time and also motivate people to do better. If I have given my best shot and not able to move forward, I am not hesitant to reach out to relevant people for help.

## Preferred time to work

I prefer 10:30-18:30 as my mornings are busier.

## Feelings to receiving messages outside work hours

I prefer to respond only to urgent messages outside work hours.

## How to show up when I'm feeling off

I take a long breathe and meditate before starting afresh.

## Things that make me anxious

Communication deadlocks, too many processes.

## Technical areas of knowledge

Java, dot net, oracle, sql server, power builder, linux and many other tools used in support. I am not an expert but I know how to solve problems :) 

## Technical interests to learn

## Current personal project

Learning how to read music and playing piano.

## What I fear

Free Fall.
