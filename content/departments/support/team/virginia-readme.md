# Virginia README

### My view on customer support

Getting help should be effortless, reliable, and leave a customer with good vibes for Sourcegraph. Useful information, effective communication, and not leaving the customer wondering if they will hear back from you goes a very long way.

### Preferred learning styles

I am very much a tactile learner. I need to "do" to really get it and that works best when I can also ask someone questions if I get stuck.

### Communication style

I operate best when I have context. I value emotion as much as data and find both important to understanding full context. Depending on the situation, I might prefer asynchronous or synchronous communication (whatever the situation calls for). I am definitely someone who needs to process and consider things before I have much to say.

### Preferred way to collaborate

I am open to whatever the situation calls for and/or what others prefer. I tend to be more creative later in the day and again, I am a processor.

### How I approach problems

I start with openness and curiosity, a first-principle thinking approach. I tend to ask a lot of questions to make sure I understand the problem before I move on to imagining a solution. When it comes to the solution, I like to have lots of perspectives involved, very much believing the best answer is when many voices are heard.

### Preferred way to be recognized/appreciated

A quiet note goes a long way. I appreciate public recognition, but it also makes me feel super awkward. I am also still very much learning how to receive praise.

### Thoughts/feelings/preferences when it comes to asking for help

I prefer being asked questions to understand what I have done so far instead of being met with statements full of assumptions.

### What I find enjoyable at work

Like all of life, it's all about the people, relationships, and connection for me.

### What kind of work do I find easiest to do when

I can function anytime, but I am definitely more of a night person and tend to be a lot more creative in the afternoon/evening. If I need to do quiet work, I am likely to work in the evening and leave early another day in the week.

### How do I feel about getting messages after/outside of hours that are meant for me to see and respond to during active hours

I respect my time and if I am not working, I have no problem leaving something for tomorrow. It took me a bit to train myself to do this, but it has made a huge difference to my well being.

### How folks can best show up for me when I seem off

Ask me if work is the best place for me today. That makes me pause and reflect and whatever I say in response is usually very accurate.

### Things I am aware of that trigger anxious feelings/feelings of less than at work

I struggle with anxiety and feel most anxious in a work setting when I feel I have hurt someone or let someone down somehow.

### Technical areas of knowledge

I am the least technical person on the team, but very technical savvy and learn how to fit things together. If I can learn how to rebuild a 1974 VW bug from the short block up, I can learn enough about code search and all that comes with it to do my job!

### Technical areas of interest to learn

Continously developing my understanding of the product to a depth necessary to make healthy decisions.

### Current personal project

### Something I fear

I try to choose something other than fear. When I start to feel anxious or nervous (what I feel before fear), I work hard to understand what's going on so it doesn't get to a point where I feel fear.

### A quote I like

> Where shame makes us freeze and try to get really small and invisible, pleasure invites us to move, to open, to grow.

### How I eat fries

Ketchup on the side, sometimes I dip, sometimes I don't; and you know what, I am okay with mayo and other dipping sauces, too! Also, I think tater tots are more satisfying than fries.

### My sun, moon, and rising signs

Cancer sun, Sagittarius moon, Virgo rising (I seem organized, but really I just feel things deeply, want to play and have fun, and always want to cook for everyone!)
