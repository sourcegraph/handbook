# Collections Class Matrix

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of the collections class matrix is to easily determine both the reason for the outstanding balance as well as the responsible party for the collection. This is designed to provide Sales, leadership, and the Finance Group with an easy to understand guide as to the status of various receivables and the appropriate action items for those receivables.
