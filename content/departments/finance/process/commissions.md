Commissions are paid on a monthly basis. Commissions are calculated by the 4th business day of the month, finalized on the 5th business day, and paid on the 15th payroll. All commissioned teammates processed in CaptivateIQ, will be able to review their draft statements in CaptivateIQ for accuracy before the noon deadline on the 5th business day. Any corrections that come from inquiries after that deadline, will roll into the next commission cycle

# Commission Types

## Account Executives

### Plan Quota

Account Executives (AE’s) have an annual quota plan. That plan is based on three different measures with annual OTI being weighted between the three measures as follows:

- **New Annual Contract Value** - 60% of Annual OTI
- **New Logo Retention** (Individual Goal) - 20% of Annual OTI
  - NLG is a semi-annual goal and will reset halfway through the year
- **Gross Retention Rate (GRR)** (Individual Goal) - 20% of Annual OTI

### New Annual Contract Value Payout

ACV payout is paid monthly and is determined by the new ACV booked in a month by the AE. ACV included two tiers, the base tier, or Tier 1 (plan quota) and Tier 2, which is any AVC booked over quota.

- **Tier 1 (T1)** - This is the quota assigned to the AE in their plan and paid at the Base Commission Rate which is calculated by dividing the ACV OTI by their ACV Quota
- **Tier 2 (T2)** - This is any ACV earned over the T1 quota, and is paid at an accelerated BCR (BCR \* 200%)

### New Logo Generation

NLG is paid monthly and at a flat dollar amount based on NLG OTI. NLG earned over the quota is paid out at the accelerated rate of 120%

### Gross Retention Rate

GRR is paid out at year end as a bonus and will be calculated by sales leadership and provided to accounting for processing. A Quarterly draw of $2,500 will be paid to each AE with the final true-payout occurring once a year at year-end

All AE’s who start after the current year plan start date (February 1st of every year), will be considered on Ramp. The ramping period lasts 6 months and is defined by a prorated quota as well as a draw bonus equal to their monthly OTI for the first three months.

The prorated quota is a calculation based on their OTI, Ramping period and the plan assigned to the AE. Once the 6 months has passed, they will them be measured against their plan quota (see above Plan Quota)

### Transitioned Accounts
