# Paying bills

## Airbase Limits

Generally, you should feel free to spend in ways that are in the best interest of the business (see our philosophy in [spending company money](../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/spending-company-money.md)).

Specific categories of purchases that are listed on the [spending company money page](../../../benefits-pay-perks/benefits-perks/spending-company-money.md) (e.g. laptops, home office setup, etc.) do not need to follow the approval process below. They are pre-approved and can be [submitted for reimbursement](../../../benefits-pay-perks/pay-expenses/expenses.md) directly.

However, if you intend to make any other purchase that falls above the limits below, please refer to our [Company accounts payable policy](ap.md).

| Amount (Annual Equivalent) | Approval Required                                       | Recommend Method of Payment |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| $0–$10,000                 | Direct Manager                                          | Airbase                     |
| $10,000 – $50,000          | Direct Manager, Department Head, FP&A                   | Airbase                     |
| $50,000 or greater         | Direct Manager, Department Head, FP&A, VP of Operations | Airbase                     |

## Airbase Corporate credit cards

Managers and above are eligible to receive corporate credit cards for team purchases. We use [Airbase](https://dashboard.airbase.io/home), which allows you to receive a physical card, or to use a vendor specific virtual card if desired.

Just [contact the finance team](../index.md#contact) if you believe you are eligible for one and would like to have one. By default, the following monthly limits apply, but they can be raised if requested.

| Role                                       | Default monthly credit limit |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Department leads (VP-level or above)       | $10,000                      |
| Managers and Directors                     | $1,000                       |
| Analyst and Senior Analyst (with approval) | $500                         |

**Physical Credit Cards**: For corporate purchases on Airbase cards $25, please provide receipts. As a cardholder you will be responsible for providing the correct expense categories in Airbase and uploading receipts for all purchases. Failure to do so after warnings will result in your card being cancelled. Items purchased on a company credit should not be added to invoices or expense reports. Note that these cards take 7 days to ship within the US and longer for international addresses. These cards are tied to a specific teammate rather than a specific vendor. **All charges must be categorized and receipts added by the last day of the month in order to allow us to close the books**.

**Virtual Credit Cards**: Virtual cards are tied to a specific vendor rather than an individual. All recurring software spend should be on a virtual credit card rather than a Physical Credit card. Requests how-to can be found here [Request Virtual Cards and Purchase Orders in Airbase](https://help.airbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407660486164-Request-Virtual-Cards-and-Purchase-Orders-in-Airbase-)

Receipts can be added directly in Airbase and directions can be found here [Manage Receipts](https://help.airbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053509271-Manage-Receipts-in-Receipt-Inbox-)

If you have a purchase that you’d like to explain/clarify post about it in the #finance Slack channel (e.g. if it's some new system for the team) or email `ap@sourcegraph.com` (e.g. if it's a personal reimbursable expense).

## Getting invoices paid

As of April 1, 202022, all spend over $5,000 requires a PO prior to processing the invoices. Failure to have a PO will results in a delayed payment to your vendor.

If you intend to make a purchase that will be paid by invoice (e.g., if it's too large to pay by credit card), send it to [ap@sourcegraph.com](mailto:ap@sourcegraph.com) with the vendor's W-9 (if a new vendor). It is the responsibility of the purchaser to obtain the vendor W-9. Invoices will not be paid without this.

The finance & accounting team will ask any questions as needed, and submit it for payment.
