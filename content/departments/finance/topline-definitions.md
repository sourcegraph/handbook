### Net dollar retention

Net dollar retention (NDR) is measures how much revenue a cohort is generating (expansion - churn) in a given period relative to its original size (dollar amount).

Calculation: (Beginning period ARR + existing customer expansion - churn/contraction) / beginning period ARR

For example, if a quarterly cohort is $100k of new business and the following quarter their expansion (net of churn) is $25k, their quarterly NDR will be ($100k + $25k)/$100k = 125%.

### Customer Count

Number of customers with an _active_ contractual financial commitment at a point in time.

### Average Sales Price (ASP)

The average initial contract price per new business (calculated as New Business IARR / New Logo Count over a given period). Excludes any service or one time revenue.

### Average Revenue per User (ARPU)

Measures how much ARR is generated per user account.

Calculation: ARR / Total number of committed users

### Gross Renewal Rate

Gross Renewal Rate is the percentage of ARR renewed in a given period and is a key ARR forecast input assumption. Helps assess renewal strategy performance and future loss of revenue.

Calculation: $ amount of ARR renewed / Total $ amount of ARR up for renewal (excludes any expansion IARR and MTM deals)
