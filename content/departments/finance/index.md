### Fiscal years

A fiscal year is a one-year period that corporations like Sourcegraph use for accounting and budgeting. Sourcegraph's fiscal year runs from February 1 to January 31. Having our fiscal year offset by one month from the calendar year ensures that our fiscal Q4 doesn't end during December holidays, making our quarters more even and predictable, and eliminating pre-New Year stress for our sales, finance, and other teammates.

**Fiscal years that don't align with calendar years (such as our fiscal year) are referred to by the year in which the period ends**.

### Fiscal year 2023

- **FY23 Q1**: 01 February, 2022–30 April, 2022
- **FY23 Q2**: 01 May, 2022–31 July, 2022
- **FY23 Q3**: 01 August, 2022–31 October, 2022
- **FY23 Q4**: 01 November, 2022–31 January, 2023

## FY23 Budget

The FY23 plan was communicated, and approved, by the Board, at January 22, 2022. You can see the details of the plan [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lpLVcSnMQxtShbrB2w4GfX_V70mPkiS12lFHsRDCGgk/edit#slide=id.g7d2aea8729_0_0). At the time of completing this plan, the expected company headcount as of year end FY22 was 252. The plan approved for an addition of 130 heads in FY23 meaning that we will exit FY23 with 382. The plan also captures significant growth for year on year investment in our marketing program spend, software spend, and professional services spend. The plan was built following detailed consultation and input from our Leadership team. We focused on the key questions:

- Where do we need to invest dollars in order to deliver incremental ARR?
- Where do we need to invest dollars in order to stay ahead of our competition?
- What other investments do we need to make in order to ensure that the business can operate efficiently and effectively, whilst maintaining ambitious growth targets?

When reviewing and finalizing our plan, we met with our investors and leveraged benchmark guidance that they were able to provide on companies who are experiencing similar growth, opportunities and challenges. We used these benchmarks to gauge our growth and spend versus this peer group.

**How the plan was built**

The FY23 plan was built at a departmental level. We have 9 departments:

| Department           | Department (Budget owner) |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| R&D Engineering      |                           |
| R&D Product          | Quinn Slack               |
| Marketing            |                           |
| Sales                | Greg Batis                |
| Customer Support     |                           |
| Customer Engineering | Aimee Menne               |
| Operations           | Dan Adler                 |
| Talent & People-ops  | Carly Jones               |
| Exec                 | Connor O' Brien           |

Within each department, there are also cost centers. The cost center structure can be viewed within Bamboo. The FY23 plan was built by allocating and reviewing costs at the cost center level. This structure allowed us to be more detailed and analytical in our investment plan.

**How we will monitor performance versus plan**

Following each month end at FY23, the finance team will share a reporting pack with the head of each department that will outline the following:

- Cost (on a $ basis) versus plan for that month and for that quarter to date
- Updated forecast for the remainder of fiscal quarter, and year, versus plan
- Headcount versus plan
- Company level metrics
  - ARR vs plan
  - Burn vs plan

The above information will be shared via Google slides on business Day +8 following the monthly financial close. As part of this review process, Finance and Department leads will also evaluate our investments for the remainder of the fiscal year and determine if any adjustments are required. There are a number of scenarios that could require us to make an adjustment that would deviate from the plan. Some of these might include:

- A marketing program has generated a significant amount of opportunities beyond expectation.
- We want to allocate more dollars to this program.
- Our Engineering and Product team believe that there is an opportunity to invest in a feature that will have a meaningful impact on our ARR growth.
- We see inbound activity beyond what was planned and we need to adjust the hiring plan for the sales team.
- Our pace of growth is negatively impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions. We determine that spending refinements are required in order to manage and maintain our forecasted cash position.

The monthly review that will take place between Finance and Department leads should identify the gaps and opportunities that exist. Any adjustments will be documented and provided to the VP of Operations who will provide final sign-off.

**Adjustments to investment plan outside of monthly review cycle**

Our goal is to ensure financial discipline, however, as a Finance team, we also do not want to constrain growth, or be slow to react when we determine that a team is lacking resources and is under prolonged pressure. We understand that there will be certain occasions where department leads may wish to make an adjustment to their budget. When a department lead determines that it is necessary to complete an off cycle adjustment to the budget, please provide the following detail:

- If headcount related, please provide the following information:
  - complete the [headcount change request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFhEOLKHIvgopTGUxWjOxIPxrhaQqNdwq0_9eUlsvQyfrhsg/formResponse)
- If non- headcount related, please provide the following information:
  - What is the product, service that we are looking to purchase?
  - What is the purpose of this product or service?
  - Who from Sourcegraph will manage the vendor relationship?
  - What is the business need for the adjustment to the budget?
  - What is the opportunity loss if we do not proceed with this adjustment?

For non Headcount related requests, the above detail should be provided to the finance team via the slack #vendor-request channel. The finance team will commit to respond within 24 hours.
