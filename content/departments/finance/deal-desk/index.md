# Deal Desk

Deal Desk supports Sales on non-standard deal structures, offering collaborative support and guidance on contract components in order to deliver compliant
documents:

- We coordinate internal approvals of paperwork with other internal stakeholders
- We support Sales throughout the deal closing process.

You can reach out to us through our #deal-desk slack Channel or through our alias: dealdesk@sourcegraph.com.

Deal Desk´s SLA is one business day. Please flag any urgent request or inquiry to ensure appropriate coverage.

Desk Desk process updates and announcements will be communicated via #deal-desk and #sales Slack channels, and support during holidays and PTOs will be announced via the #deal-desk channel.
