# Deal Desk FAQs

Below are answers to common questions Sales teammates at Sourcegraph have.

## Agreements, Forms and other templates

### Where can I find the most recent Order Form templates?

You can download the latest Order Form templates here: [Sales Resources](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/sales/tools/salesresources/). We have 2 OF templates available:

- [Sourcegraph Pre-4.0 Order Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oo7vbWoGIaIq72zo7TFH9M4eugJXrvNv/edit)
- [Sourcegraph 4.0 OF: Code Intelligence Platform](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KOje_f8rc1sx8oxxRR4nwqnzi9WBXqmxisFl85zuDok/edit)

Please download the applicable one and drop your copy in the following g-drive folder: [New Customer in Progress](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o2xBbEp0gy-N1f27RB_vu7CzdSPNRwXQ) (create a new customer folder).

Also, you may use CPQ to create your quote and DealHub will automatically generate the OF for you.

### How can I validate if a customer has a signed MSA in place?

You can check previous signed agreements in our google drive folder: Customer Contracts . For renewal and expansion deals, there is no need to reference the executed agreement date in the new order form but you should make sure we have signed Terms in place with the Customer. Here's our standard wording for renewal and expansion deals:

“This Order Form is governed by the terms, along with any applicable addenda and amendments, executed by and between the parties (“Terms”). No terms or conditions of any purchase order will modify this Agreement or affect the obligations of the parties.”
