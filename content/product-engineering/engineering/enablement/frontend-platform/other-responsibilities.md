# Frontend Platform: Other responsibilities

This page lists some of the other reponsibilities of the [Frontend Platform
team](./index.md).

## @frontend-devs

The [Frontend Platform team](./enablement/frontend-platform/index.md)
maintains the canonical list of frontend developers at Sourcegraph, which
includes all engineers with expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript
(even if they don't exclusively do frontend development).

The people on this list may be called on to:

- give their opinions on frontend tooling at Sourcegraph
- review frontend PRs
- do frontend interviews and assignment grading

These people are available under the `@frontend-devs` alias on both
Slack and [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/frontend-devs)
(the two lists are kept in sync). Please contact the
Frontend Platform team to add or remove someone from the list.

## Frontend Crew

Frontend Crew is a biweekly, technically-focused get-together for all frontend
(or frontend-curious) developers at the company. The idea is similar to a
"guild" in the [Spotify model](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf):

> A Guild is a more organic and wide-reaching “community of interest”, a group
> of people that want to share knowledge, tools, code, and practices. Chapters
> are always local to a Tribe, while a guild usually cuts across the whole
> organization.
