# Sourcegraph engineering career development framework

Our career development framework is here to help you understand the expectations of your role, and to provide a common language for you and your manager to discuss and plan your career growth. It is also an important part of our larger goal of ensuring everyone is equitably recognized for the impact they have at work, and to reduce bias in promotions and hiring.

## What are the expectations of my role?

There are currently seven levels for software engineers at Sourcegraph. A level is composed of three categories, each with a summary statement and several example behaviors. These categories are:

- Proficiency
- Execution
- Teamwork

It's important to understand that what is listed in the level descriptions are example behaviors, and not checkboxes for promotion. Doing everything listed there is neither necessary nor sufficient for a promotion.
The expectation is that you demonstrate a _level of impact_ consistent with each of the category descriptions for your level.
The [magnitude of your impact](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/software-engineer-career-paths/) is ultimately the measure of your career growth.

In most cases, a level builds on the expectations from the preceding levels: someone at level 2 must also meet the level 1 expectations.
In addition to what is listed there, we expect engineers at all levels to exhibit [our values](../../../company-info-and-process/values/index.md).

Rather than precede each bullet point with "Consistently", we leave it as implicit.

The level descriptions correspond to the start of the level, so that if an IC has a level N impact in all categories, they should then be promoted to level N (and not before). Or to put it another way, the level descriptions state the minimum expectations.

These are the expectations for ICs _after they have completed their onboarding_. Some of these expectations (such as around communication) would start on day 1, but others (such as expertise in the codebase) would not be expected until they are fully ramped up.

In line with our _continuously grow_ company value, we expect every engineer to eventually reach at least level 3.
It is the responsibility of your manager to track this, and to ensure that you are given the support and opportunities needed for career growth.

## When do I get promoted?

When your manager can make the case that you’ve had at least one quarter of high performance at your current level, and one quarter performing at the next level, in all three of the categories. It takes time to demonstrate the “consistently” implicit in the expectations, and we don’t want to promote anyone to a level in which they will struggle.

Promotions from one level to another are considered in our quarterly [talent review](talent-review-process.md).
An in-band compensation increase (while staying at the same level) can happen at any time, in recognition of exceeding expectations in your current level without having yet met the expectations of the next level.
