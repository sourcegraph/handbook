# Cloud

Our vision is to offer the fastest, most seamless way for development teams to bring Sourcegraph into their workflows, wherever they are.

- “seamless way” → if Sourcegraph cloud is a method of deploying Sourcegraph, we’re solving the problem of “bringing Sourcegraph in,” not “making code search better.”
- “development teams” → includes developers themselves, engineering managers, and the intersections with the rest of their org chart. Also steps away from the question of team scale, and encompasses all sizes of customer.
- “into their workflows” → Sourcegraph cloud is more than sourcegraph.com and code search, and Sourcegraph cloud offers unique opportunities for integration into existing workflows in ways that self-hosted deployments might not be able to support.
