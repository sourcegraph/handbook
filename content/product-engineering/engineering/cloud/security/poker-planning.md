# Poker-Planning

### Agile Poker Story Points

The design of this process was to help organizations more accurately estimate development time frames, build consensus among the members of the cross-functional team, and more strategically plan the teamâ€™s work.

This particular methodology is particularly effective for smaller teams. The main goal is to avoid the influences of other team members and to engage the team in a discussion on the particular issue.  This method has been shown to result in more accurate estimation.

1: Small effort task - Have the individual knowledge and tooling required.  

2: Medium effort task - Have the individual knowledge and tooling required.  

3: External dependencies exist such as: reviews, approvals. Time is required from others and the task is non-trivial.  

5: Like 3, but bigger scope.  

8: MANY external dependencies: e.g. understanding and approval from other many teams.  

13+: Break into smaller tasks and/or sub-tasks.  


Story Points = Complexity + Dependency + Scope
