### Agile Poker Story Points

The design of this process was to help organizations more accurately estimate development time frames, build consensus among the members of the cross-functional team, and more strategically plan the team’s work.

This particular methodology is particularly effective for smaller teams. The main goal is to avoid the influences of other team members and to engage the team in a discussion on the particular issue. This method has been shown to result in more accurate estimation.

1: Small effort task - Have the individual knowledge and tooling required.

2: Medium effort task - Have the individual knowledge and tooling required.

3: External dependencies exist such as: reviews, approvals. Time is required from others and the task is non-trivial.

5: Like 3, but bigger scope.

8: MANY external dependencies: e.g. understanding and approval from other many teams.

13+: Break into smaller tasks and/or sub-tasks.

Story Points = Complexity + Dependency + Scope
