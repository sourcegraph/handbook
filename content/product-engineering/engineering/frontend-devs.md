# Frontend Developers

The [Frontend Platform team](./enablement/frontend-platform/index.md)
maintains the canonical list of frontend developers at Sourcegraph, which
includes all engineers with expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript
(even if they don't exclusively do frontend development).

The people on this list may be called on to:

- give their opinions on frontend tooling at Sourcegraph
- review frontend PRs
- do frontend interviews and assignment grading

These people are available under the `@frontend-devs` alias on both
Slack and [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/teams/frontend-devs)
(the two lists are kept in sync). Please contact the
Frontend Platform team to add or remove someone from the list.
