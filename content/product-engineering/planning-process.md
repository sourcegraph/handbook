# Product/Engineering planning process

Our planning process defines how we create goals and track progress toward those goals as a department.

## Philosophy

A good plan has the following properties:

- The plan addresses the most important business needs (and is subject to change if the business needs change).
- The plan is ambitious and feasible.
- The plan provides a clear direction about what success looks like so the teams have space to figure out how to achieve success and so teams understand what is not a priority.

Arriving at a good plan is an iterative process that is neither exclusively top-down nor exclusively bottom-up because there is a cyclical information dependency. Company level strategy is informed by what is working and not working about our business (context our teams have), and team plans are informed by what our company level strategy is (a decision ultimately owned by the CEO). Fundmentally, everyone on our team has context and insights that are valuable inputs into the planning process.

In practice, both the top-down motion and bottoms-up motion happen concurrently, but we need to bootstrap the process to iteratively work through the information dependency. It is helpful to think about planning as having a `W` shape:

## Definitions

- Our **[strategy](strategy.md)** is a concise description of how product and engineering contribute to the top-level company objectives. It sets a clear direction so we stay focused on what is important and have appropriate trade-off discussions if necessary. This is the **WHY**.
- **[OKRs](../strategy-goals/goals/guidelines.md)** define how we measure success. This is the **WHAT**.
- **Roadmap items** are the concrete high-level things that we are delivering to achieve success (as measured by OKRs). This is the **HOW**.

## Annual planning process

The goal of our annual planning process is to create and maintain a 1 year top level strategy that teams can reference during each quarterly planning process.

We go through this full process in Q4 and a lightweight version of this every quarter to review and make necessary updates.

| Week of quarter | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
