# Product/Engineering Department Meeting

Our team is rapidly growing and we want to provide a forum to:

- share department updates
- drive alignment around our initiatives and strategy
- celebrate wins and build engagement
- provide everyone an opportunity to ask questions

Audience

- All of Product/Engineering

Cadence

- Once a quarter (meeting will be recorded for those who can't attend live)

Format & content

- A video update will be shared a week in advance for people to review async, including a link to submit questions and upvote the questions for Product/eng leadership to answer live

  - The video update may contain: OKR progress updates, org updates, new processes, guest speakers from other departments, etc.

- 30 min live Q&A session

  - Live Q&A is meant to foster conversation and discussion. Please watch content in advance of the meeting and submit your questions before the call to maximize value of time spent synchronously.

  - You can start adding your questions and/or comments to the Q&A doc a week before the live Q&A session.

  - Preface your question with your full name (first and last name) or "anonymous" if you prefer to remain unknown.

  - If someone submitted a question you want to upvote add "+1" next to it so we can prioritize questions accordingly.

  - During the Q&A please add additional information and comments to the Q&A doc vs. Zoom chat so people not attending live can also benefit
  - You can continue to add questions to the end of the queue in the Q&A doc as the live Q&A is taking place.

  - If we don't get through all the questions during the live Q&A, they will get answered async in the Q&A doc.

## Recordings

The meeting recording and notes will be posted on Slack on #prod-eng-announce after the meeting finishes.
