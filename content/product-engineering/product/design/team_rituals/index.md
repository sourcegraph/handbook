# Team rituals

As an asynchronous-first, globally-distributed design team, our team rituals help bring us together as a design team and build stronger trust, physiological safety, and connections.

## Design club

The design club is our weekly sync to help us keep the pulse of product design at Sourcegraph. We use this time to:

- Share updates and highlights, and request feedback on work in progress
- Discuss design-related issues with peers
- Reflect on how we work as a product design team
- Stay inspired

We have a [running design club doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VWU0m-JE2l2HvugnTEJTa1-_4R5gx9UwSvZtSpT08Ew/edit#heading=h.t56omfxbhue7) that we use to share and discuss topics asynchronously ahead of time. Each week, we rotate who facilitates.

A typical design club includes:

- An icebreaker activity
- A few minutes of silent reading and adding any extra topics or comments to the agenda
- Sharing current topics
- Sharing design inspiration

This design club is open to anyone, but is first for the product design team.

## Design critiques

Our [design critique process](../design_critiques/index.md) is informal right now, and very much project-team based. As a team, we’re planning to define a more structured design critique format and rhythm to better share our work within the design team.

## Retros

We run [team retrospectives](../../../../retrospectives/index.md) on a monthly basis to help us continuously learn and improve. We focus mainly on collaboration and our processes.
