## Wildcard

Product management exists as a collection of skills. Sometimes the most powerful insights come from completely independent readings. These do not fit into a traditional category though have a strong impact on creating world-class products.

- [Syntax & Sage: Reflections on Software and Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Syntax-Sage-Reflections-Software-Nature/dp/0692563636/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=syntax+and+sage&qid=1626752467&sr=8-3) - This collection of small essays from a former CS professor, Google exec, and startup CEO are powerfully deep yet don't require hours of reading to understand. The focus on Marshall McLuhan's idea "We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us" is one of the most important learnings for all PMs to understand.
