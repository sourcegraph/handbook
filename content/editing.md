# Editing the handbook

Every Sourcegraph teammate will be editing the Sourcegraph handbook frequently to keep information up-to-date and participate in important changes in the company. This guide helps everyone learn how to edit the handbook.

The handbook consists of Markdown files in the Git repository at [github.com/sourcegraph/handbook](https://github.com/sourcegraph/handbook/tree/main/content). ([Why not a wiki or Google Docs?](usage.md#wiki-and-google-docs-handbooks-become-stale))

## How to get help

We don't expect everyone on the team to figure this out on their own. Other teammates are happy to help!

- Any engineer at Sourcegraph can help. (The _code_ that engineers write at Sourcegraph also consists of files in a Git repository, so engineers are very familiar with making these kinds of edits.)
- [Teammates who have already made a handbook change](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/about/-/stats/contributors?path=handbook%2F) can help.
- **Handbook support**: Ask the @handbook-support group in Slack (formerly called "handbook heroes"), including @aharvey, @virginia, @ines, @jyavorska, @marybelzer, and @jean, for handbook help (via DM, #handbook, or #any-question). They volunteered to help anyone with anything handbook-related! _If you too want to be part of handbook support, simply edit this page, add your name to the list and ping @handbook-support in the #handbook channel to inform them_
- Ask in #handbook: "Who can screen-share with me to help me make an edit to the handbook?"
- Don't be afraid of breaking anything! It is very easy for any engineer on the team to roll back to the previous version of the handbook if you make a mistake.

## Overview

Here's the process for getting a change published to the handbook. For detailed step-by-step instructions (intended for people who are new to Git), see the sections below.

![Editing the Handbook Flow](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/Editing%20the%20Handbook.jpg)

1. Make sure you've been added to [Sourcegraph's Github Org](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about). If you need access, contact Tech Ops in the #it-tech-ops Slack channel.
1. Propose the edits you want to make by creating a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on the Git repository at [github.com/sourcegraph/about](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about).
   - Because the [handbook is public](usage.md#why-make-this-handbook-public), anyone in the world can see your proposed edits.
1. Make sure the [handbook checks pass](#handbook-checks).
1. You can request a review from specific teammates (who will get a notification) on the GitHub pull request page.
   - We don't have any rules around who needs to review what changes. Use your judgment (e.g., if your change affects the entire engineering team, request review from the VP Engineering).
   - For minor edits, you can skip review.
1. Wait for the necessary teammates to review and approve your pull request.
1. Merge the pull request.
   - If you forget to merge your pull request, you'll be reminded about it after 14 days of inactivity on that pull request. If the pull request sees another 7 days of inactivity, it will be automatically closed.
1. Wait up to 5 minutes for your change to be live on handbook.sourcegraph.com.<br>
   Live deployment status: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4c81a998-33b5-4357-a593-479e21bb10f3/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sourcegraph-handbook/deploys)
1. Use the #handbook-announce label to notify other people of important handbook updates on the #handbook-announce Slack channel.

#### How do I know if I'm being asked to review someone's proposal?

If someone has selected you as a reviewer or an approver, you will receive a notification from Github. You can also visit [this link](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+review-requested%3A%40me) to see proposed Handbook changes waiting on a review from you.

#### Can I review and comment on a proposal, even if I wasn't asked?

Yes! Our repo is public, and you can see new Handbook proposals in the #handbook-updates Slack channel. If something looks interesting to you, you're welcome to review and give feedback. In alignment with our [values](company/values.md) to work as a team, act with high agency, and be open and transparent, teammates are encouraged to review and comment on proposals where they feel they can add value.

## Edit a single file

If you just need to edit a single page, you can do it entirely on the web.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MsIGvw0IEzo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br/>

1. Visit the handbook page you want to edit on about.sourcegraph.com.
1. Press the **Edit this page** button in the sidebar.
   - If you don't see it, you may be viewing a page on about.sourcegraph.com that is not part of the handbook. Handbook pages all have the same design as the [main handbook page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook). If it has a different design, [ask for help](#how-to-get-help).
1. In the text editor, make your edits.
   - The document is in a format called Markdown that lets you use headings, links, bold, lists, etc., in a plain text file. See "[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)" and feel free to [ask for help](#how-to-get-help).
1. Switch back and forth to the **Preview changes** tab at the top of the editor to see the nicely rendered page with your edits applied.
   - Deletions are shown in red, changes are shown in orange, and additions are shown in green.
1. When you're happy with your edits, scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Commit changes** box.
   - Type a short, one-line summary of your change in the first text field (instead of the default `Update filename.md` text).
   - Type a more detailed explanation of your change in the larger text field.
   - Select the **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** option (if it's not already selected).
   - Press the **Commit changes** button.
1. Press the **Create pull request** button. Now your change has been proposed!
   - You can share the link to the pull request with anyone to show them your proposed change (e.g., `https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/pull/123).
1. If you want this update to be published in the Slack channel #handbook-announce, select the handbook-announce label using the **Label** button on the right side of the pull request page.
1. Select teammates to review using the **Reviewers** button on the right side of the pull request page.
1. Wait for teammates to review, comment on, and approve your pull request.
1. When you're ready to publish the change and make it live, press the **Squash and merge** button, then press **Confirm squash and merge**.
1. Wait for your change to be live on about.sourcegraph.com. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.

### Announcing Handbook Changes

All Handbook-related pull request information is automatically announced in the #handbook-updates Slack channel. This channel can get a bit noisy, so you may want to announce an important update in the #handbook-announce channel. To do this:

1. Open your pull request. Since you're planning to announce this change, it will be helpful to add context about your change as a comment when creating your pull request.
1. Click the **Labels** section on the right side of the Github screen
1. Search for "handbook-announce" and select it
   - ![Announcing Handbook Changes](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbookannouncelabelimage.png)
1. Merge your pull request.
1. See your pull request appear in #handbook-announce.

### Handbook checks

> If you are running the handbook locally, you can run these checks before you push your commit, [explained in the readme](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about#handbook).

On your Github pull request page, you'll notice a green checkmark or a red X-mark next to your commits. This information repeated at the end of the page with a "Some checks were not successful" in red or "All checks have passed" in green.

These "checks" are automated formatting and structural rules that run on your new changes. The goal is to help you catch common errors before you merge your pull request to the handbook, because if a handbook user hits these errors when they are live, it's a poor experience.

Ideally, you won't merge your pull request unless all checks have passed and are "green." If you see any red failed checks then you can click the red "X" and then click on the tooltip to be taken to more details ([example page with red X build](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/pull/3564); [example details page](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/runs/2976049292)).

If you're not sure what the error message means or can't determine how to fix it, you are welcome to ask for help in Slack's #handbook and optionally tag @handbook-support, but first refer to the common errors:

#### Interpreting handbook check failures: most common examples

- **Must link to .md files ([example](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/runs/2976049292))**: `handbook/product/user_feedback.md: must link to .md file, not ../support/support-workflow` means that the error is in the file (handbook page) `handbook/product/user_feedback.md`, and the error is that there is a link to a URL rather than the markdown file of the page itself.
  - **Fix:** add an `.md` and make the link to `../support/support-workflow.md` instead of `../support/support-workflow`.
  - **Note:** if there is an anchor tag in the link, the `.md` goes before the anchor tag, like `../support/support-workflow.md#support-workflow`.
- **Disconnected page ([example](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/runs/2975885844)):** `handbook/engineering/hiring/engineering-leadership.md: disconnected page (no inlinks from other pages)` means that the error is _not_ in the file `handbook/engineering/hiring/engineering-leadership.md`, but rather there are no pages in the handbook linking to this file page.
  - **Fix:** Determine if this page is still valuable, and if so, on which other handbook page to add a link to this page. If it's not obvious or you're not sure, you should post for help in #handbook and tag someone you think might know better (based on the content of the disconnected page).
  - See [this section](#using-relative-paths-to-link-handbook-pages) to learn how to use relative paths to link Handbook pages. This helps us maintain links over time more easily than pasting a URL.

## Edit multiple files or add a new file

To make edits to multiple files and submit all of the edits as a group to be reviewed together, you will follow a more complex process than when . This also is required for adding new files.

> NOTE: These steps are not exhaustively documented. Please [ask for help](#how-to-get-help) as many times as you need to until you feel comfortable with this process.

### Web interface

#### Multiple changes in a single PR

A screen recording of how to make multiple changes in a single PR in the web interface for GitHub:

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UL3JqbXEGLaVXEkk4G81wGO69z8J_Cbw/preview" width="560" height="315"></iframe>

##### Steps:

This is just one path for making multiple changes in a single PR in the Handbook. These steps can be completed in a different order, or outside of the Github web interface.

1. Visit the first handbook page you want to edit on about.sourcegraph.com.
1. Press the **Edit this page** button in the sidebar.
   - If you don't see it, you may be viewing a page on about.sourcegraph.com that is not part of the handbook. Handbook pages all have the same design as the [main handbook page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook). If it has a different design, [ask for help](#how-to-get-help).
1. In the text editor, make your edits.
   - The document is in a format called Markdown that lets you use headings, links, bold, lists, etc., in a plain text file. See "[Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)" and feel free to [ask for help](#how-to-get-help).
1. Switch back and forth to the **Preview changes** tab at the top of the editor to see the nicely rendered page with your edits applied.
   - Deletions are shown in red, changes are shown in orange, and additions are shown in green.
1. When you're happy with your edits, scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Commit changes** box.
   - Type a short, one-line summary of your change in the first text field (instead of the default `Update filename.md` text).
   - Type a more detailed explanation of your change in the larger text field.
   - Select the **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** option (if it's not already selected).
   - Press the **Commit changes** button.
1. On the next page, click on the dropdown arrow on the “Create Pull Request” button, and choose “Create Draft Pull Request”. This will keep your PR from auto-notifying code owners or reviewers before it’s ready. Then, click “Draft Pull Request”.
   - You don't have to create a Draft Pull Request, and can create a regular one if you prefer. A Draft PR just indicates that you're still working on your changes.
1. In a new tab, navigate to the next page where you want to make changes.
   -You can do this in the same tab if you’d like, but it may be easier to keep your PR up in its own tab while you do this part.
1. Press the **Edit this page** button in the sidebar.
   - If you don't see it, you may be viewing a page on about.sourcegraph.com that is not part of the handbook. Handbook pages all have the same design as the [main handbook page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook). If it has a different design, [ask for help](#how-to-get-help).
1. Click "Cancel Changes" in the github window. This is because you want to make sure you're working in the branch you've already started.
1. Click on the branch dropdown on the upper left side of your screen (it probably says “main”). Search for the branch you named when creating your first change, and select it. Update Branch
1. Click the pencil icon to edit your file.
1. When you're happy with your edits, scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Commit changes** box.
   - Type a short, one-line summary of your change in the first text field (instead of the default `Update filename.md` text).
   - Type a more detailed explanation of your change in the larger text field.
   - Select the **Commit directly to the "branch name" branch** option (if it's not already selected).
   - Press the **Commit changes** button.
1. Return to your PR, and the checks should rerun. Once checks pass, merge your changes.

#### Making a new page

A screen recording of how to make a new file and include it for review in the web interface for GitHub:

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16iYS-idCL5FEGwoldF7rOQElcidgzo8i/preview" width="560" height="315"></iframe>

##### Steps:

_This is just one path for creating a new page in the Handbook. These steps can be completed in a different order, or outside of the Github web interface._

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new page.

   - If you aren't sure how to get there in Github, click "Edit This Page" on the Handbook page where you'd like to add your new page. Then, look for the file path towards the top of your Github page to click up into the directory:

   ![Navigate to Directory](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/navigate-to-directory.png)

1. Click Add File > Create New File
1. Name your file.
   -Make sure the name ends with ".md". This makes it a Markdown file. For example: editing.md
1. Enter your content in Markdown. See [Markdown Resources](#markdown-resources) for help with formatting.
1. When you're happy with your new page, scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Commit changes** box.
   - Type a short, one-line summary of your change in the first text field (instead of the default `Create filename.md` text).
   - Type a more detailed explanation of your change in the larger text field.
   - Select the **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** option (if it's not already selected).
   - Name your branch something memorable. You'll need to search for this branch in a future step.
   - Press the **Commit changes** button.
1. Click on the dropdown arrow on the "Create Pull Request" button, and choose "Create Draft Pull Request". This will keep your PR from auto-notifying code owners or reviewers before it's ready. Then, click "Draft Pull Request".
   -You don't have to create a Draft Pull Request at this point, you can create a regular one. A Draft PR just indicates that you're still working on this change.
1. You'll likely see that the docsite check has failed. Click "Details" on the docsite check line to see more information. If your error says "disconnected page (no inlinks from other pages)", this means you need to create a link into this page. For other failures, see [Handbook Checks](#handbook-checks).
1. In a new tab, navigate to the page where you want to create a link to your new page.
   -You can do this in the same tab if you'd like, but it may be easier to keep your PR up in its own tab while you do this part.
1. Click on the branch dropdown on the upper left side of your screen (it probably says "main"). Search for the branch you named when creating your first change, and select it.
   ![Update Branch](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/update-branch.png)
1. Click the pencil icon to edit your file.
1. Create a [link using a relative path](#using-relative-paths-to-link-handbook-pages) in the appropriate location on your page.
1. Commit your changes.
1. Return to your PR, and the checks should rerun. Click "Ready for Review" to turn your Draft PR into a regular PR. Once checks pass, merge your changes.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and commit your changes directly to your branch. You'll be directed back to your PR.
1. Click on the "Conversation" tab on your PR.
1. Wait for checks to pass and merge.

## Adding images

Pictures, images, and graphics must be uploaded to Google Cloud Storage to be added to a handbook or documentation page. See the [Technical Writing page](product/technical_writing/index.md#uploading-graphics) for instructions. Note that this is a two-step process: First, adding your image to Google Cloud Storage. Second, editing the Handbook to include your image.

## Uploading large files

If you want to upload a large file (such as a large image, video, or audio recording) and make it available in the handbook, upload the file to Google Drive and then get a shareable link to the file on Google Drive. Add that link to the handbook. Don't add large files to the handbook repository itself (because Git is not a good way to store large non-text files).

## Using relative paths to link handbook pages

When adding a link to another handbook page, it is best practise to use relative paths. A relative path refers to a location that is relative to a current directory. You can take a look at this video of Jean explaining relative paths and how they work.

<video controls src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/Relative%20paths%20in%20the%20handbook.mp4"></video>

To sum up, the path described the location of the file, naming every directory before the file (called .md). Relative paths are a way of indicating where the file is. The program that reads the relative paths interprets links from where it is at the moment, so we need to make sure to indicate if the directory is different to the one we are at the moment.

Example:
If we are linking the Buddy program handbook page (handbook/people-ops/onboarding/buddy-program.md) to the Onboarding for hiring managers page (handbook/people-ops/onboarding/onboarding-for-hiring-managers.md) we will only need to say **buddy-program.md** because they share the same directory.
However, if we want to link the Buddy program handbook page to Engineering onboarding page (handbook/engineering/onboarding.md) we would need to use ../ to go back in the directory and then indicate the correct path: **../../engineering/onboarding.md**

**Why do we do this?**
While it is possible to use absolute URLs (ones that include the domain e.g. https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook) to link to pages, if the domain changes, it is more difficult to update the URLs compared to using relative URLs.

_Remember that if the .md file name changes or the directory changes (because you’ve moved the file to another team’s page, for example) you will need to update the path._

## Moving a Page (Web Interface)

All of the following needs to occur within one pull request. See [this section](#multiple-changes-in-a-single-pr) for help on making multiple edits at once.

1. Rename the file to indicate its new location as described in [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location)
1. Address any errors in the [Handbook Checks](#handbook-checks). Since you are changing the location of a file, any existing links to that file will break. You may see errors like this:
   ![Broken Link Errors](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/relocate-page-errors.png)

## Deleting a Page (Web Interface)

See [this Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/deleting-files-in-a-repository#deleting-a-file) for deleting a file or directory through the web interface. You may encounter Handbook checks errors. Since you are changing the location of a file, any existing links to that file will break. You may see errors like this, which are explained in the [Handbook Checks](#handbook-checks) section of this page:
![Broken Link Errors](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/handbook/relocate-page-errors.png)

## Markdown Tips

1. Spacing matters when it comes to tiered lists. To indent a line in a list, add two spaces before the dash or asterisk. Incorrect spacing still allow those bullets and indents to display, but spacing and sizing may look different from the rest of your document. See more under the "Lists" section under Examples [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Markdown Resources

- [Docs to Markdown](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607) is a Google Docs Add-On that will convert your doc to Markdown for you.
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app#) gives you a side-by-side view of your doc and the corresponding Markdown version.

## Running a local preview handbook site

> NOTE: This is optional.

See the [handbook section](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about#handbook) in the repository README.

## Handbook feedback

We're constantly iterating on what the best version of our Sourcegraph handbook might look like. Is it easy to use? Do you find what you're looking for? Let us know [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfb0yU9xmnvK2namuUzUEKbB9IqZlNQF2IWw0OpLsGvBiW2oQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
