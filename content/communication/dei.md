# Diversity, equity, and inclusion

> At Sourcegraph, we want to make it so [everyone can code](../../company/strategy.md), so that technology's benefits reach the whole world. To do that, and to even understand what's necessary to do that, our team needs to represent a diverse set of perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds. We also believe that talent is equally distributed, so we strive for our team to demonstrate that by being inclusive of and equitable toward all people. This page describes our efforts and commitments to work toward these outcomes, and we expect to improve and expand our plans here as we learn and grow.

We have focused much of our efforts to-date on equity with:

*   All-remote work (including home desk and coworking space benefits)
*   Asynchronous work
*   International hiring (any city, any country, any timezone)
*   Location-independent pay
*   In progress: Standardized compensation
*   In progress: Extended option exercise periods

Currently, we are focusing on inclusion to ensure that as we grow, Sourcegraph remains a place that people from all backgrounds feel they belong. During FY22Q1 (2021-02 to 2021-04), we will:

*   Create `#DEI` focused channels (`#DEI-questions` and `#DEI-announcements`) channel where folks can ask questions, get help, share resources, and/or be kept up to date on our progress. The `#DEI-questions` channel will be staffed by folks responsible for working through answers and providing guidance.
*   Anonymously survey all employees to identify questions, feedback, and ideas that can be integrated into current and new plans related to DEI.
*   Screen for “Be welcoming and inclusive” value early in the hiring process
    *   Add it to our feedback form and any future rubrics
    *   Build in questions to recruiter and hiring manager screens to have specific checkpoints for evaluation
        *   Recommended questions to ask:
            *   What have you done to ensure co-workers feel a sense of belonging?
            *   How have you contributed to a diverse and inclusive workplace culture?
            *   Tell me about your experience working with a diverse team.
            *   How have you acted as an ally?
*   Building relationships with code schools and organizations focused on helping folks in underserved communities break into tech to help increase diversity in our candidate pipelines (as a first step toward later developing an apprenticeship program)
*   Launch standard of every employee reads and completes the exercises in Pamela Fuller’s book *The Leader’s Guide to Unconscious Bias* receives hard conversations training
    *   Review book with leadership team to confirm this is the text we want to use
    *   All execs read and complete book/exercises + training
    *   Starting next cohort(s) (rest of leadership team) of 5-7 folks each
    *   Add to new hire onboarding for all new employees
    *   Create calendar for how all existing employees will complete a cohort
*   Start collecting and reporting on company demographics + belonging (showing data for hiring, existing employees, as well as those who have exited the company)
*   Engage a to-be-determined consultant for DEI-related training for all leaders

Additionally, managers will continue to prioritize hiring outreach to increase representation and we will hire a VP Talent and recruiters to further support priority of increasing representation during hiring.

Looking ahead to the rest of FY22 and again, appreciating that this work is never done, we are also considering the following for focus:

*   Launch additional cohorts designed for ongoing learning, with a focus on putting learning into practice (required for leaders and optional for employees)
*   Create a handbook page providing additional guidance on referrals, noting that hiring managers assess referrals the same as any other candidate and offering guidance on how referrals can support our goals to have a more diverse candidate pool
*   Engage a to be determined consultant for ongoing practicum-based DEI-related training required for all leaders + determining additional areas of focus
*   Formalize employee resource groups (ERGs) so that folks from various backgrounds have safe places to seek and receive support
*   Engage Ruha Benjamin (Associate Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University) to do something with us about the concepts she shares in her book _Race After Technology_, which feel like an important set of concepts for us to internalize in support of realizing our purpose
*   Engage to be determined a consultant to review the entire handbook for coded language/ideas and create training materials to help us check for these ourselves
*   Develop an apprenticeship program (this will build on the relationships we are building with code schools and organizations focused on helping folks in underserved communities break into tech)

Some of the outcomes we plan to achieve during this FY are (we will add more as we solidify plans for items on the lists above):

*   Every employee at the company as of 2021-12-01 will complete our standard of every employee reads and completes the exercises in Pamela Fuller’s book _The Leader’s Guide to Unconscious Bias _+ receives hard conversations training
*   We are able to capture and regularly report on company demographics and belonging
*   The candidate pool for every position is comprised of at least N% candidates from underrepresented groups (we are working to measure and set this goal)

If at any point you have questions or feedback, you can always submit anonymously via our company meeting form (which is automatically posted to `#general` on Slack each week). We'll be creating DEI Slack channels for discussion and questions as well. If you are a candidate and have questions, you can email [hiring@sourcegraph.com](mailto:hiring@sourcegraph.com).
