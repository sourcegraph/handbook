# Company meeting

1. Schedule: every Monday 10:30-11:00am PST/PDT (link in the calendar event)
   - If Monday is a holiday, the meeting is held on the next non-holiday day.
   - There is no company meeting held between December 25 and December 31. The first company meeting of the year is held on the first non-holiday Monday of the year.
1. The link to the slides is posted in #general each Thursday before.
1. We used to call this "team meeting", but now we call it "company meeting" because "team meeting" sounds like it's only for one specific team inside the company.

## Agenda

1. #thanks (CEO)
   - Summary and highlights of [#thanks](team_chat.md#thanks) messages since the last company meeting, tied to our [values](../../company/values.md).
1. Introduce any new team members starting this week
   - The manager of the team member presents a brief (~30-second) intro, stating the new team member's role, why we hired them, what their first project is, and a fun fact about them.
1. Birthdays/anniversaries
1. "Developers!"
1. Inspiration of the week (message @dan to volunteer to present an inspiration)
1. Sales and marketing
1. People Ops
1. Hiring
1. Product and development updates
   - Each engineering team owns a slide that _summarizes_ relevant progress  in the last week to the rest of the company.
     - The engineering manager for each team is ultimately responsible for their team's slide, but they may delegate this responsibility to other teammates on any given week.
     - The slide should contain short bullet points for each team project that has been completed, started, or is still in progress since the last update. Usually these bullet points are items on the roadmap. Ongoing work items should be marked with the [monthly release](../engineering/releases/index.md) that they are expected to be included in (if applicable).
     - The slide should communicate how the team's progress contributes to their [quarterly OKRs](../../company/okrs/index.md), usually by inlining the teams objectives as top-level bullet points and nesting project bullet points under the relevant objective.
     - The speaker notes on the slide should be exactly what the presenter is going to say (so anyone who can't attend company meeting can quickly catch up).
     - [Here is an example of a good team slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pIoUFHpKI7jLK-F-H6z_aFke_aDZDbXZKuJff6Kf_nc/edit#slide=id.g4d25168c6a_0_55)

   - Also share these announcements in #general.
1. Q&A (questions and answers about anything company-wide)
