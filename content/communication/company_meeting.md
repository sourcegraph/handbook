# Company meeting

1. Schedule: every Monday 8:00-8:30am PST/PDT (link in the calendar event)
   - If Monday is a [holiday](../people-ops/holidays.md), the meeting is held on the next non-holiday day.
   - There is no company meeting held between December 25 and December 31. The first company meeting of the year is held on the first non-holiday Monday of the year.
1. The link to the slides is posted in #general each Thursday before.
1. We used to call this "team meeting", but now we call it "company meeting" because "team meeting" sounds like it's only for one specific team inside the company.

## Why do we have company meeting?

Company meeting is an effective way to:

1. Bring the team together regularly so we feel connected despite being [located all around the world](../../company/remote/index.md).
1. Hold ourselves accountable to our goals.
1. Share achievements or learning across teams and functions.
1. Recognize individual team members for special contributions and on anniversaries.

## Effective communication

1. Before you create or present something at company meeting, think about what you are trying to communicate.
   - What important sentiment or information do you need to share with team members? Why?
   - If you don't know, then do not present.
1. Always give brief background on your project or function, even if it sounds obvious.
   - This helps spread consistent, effective ways to talk about our company and product.
     - Example: "On campaigns, we heard from Acme Corp that..." vs. "Campaigns let you make large-scale fixes across all of your code. Acme Corp told us that..."
	 - Example: "Marketing update: our new lead sources..." vs. "Marketing is about getting enterprise developers to know about and want to try Sourcegraph. Our new lead sources..."
   - Remember that other team members are new to the company and/or busy on their own projects.
1. When speaking, remind people of your role. For example: `I'm Alice Zhao, a developer on the security team` or `I'm Bob Schmidt, and I run the website on our marketing team`.
1. Don't make announcements or share other specific information that you expect everyone to remember.
  - You can't assume everyone is attending company meeting and is paying attention.
  - Use company meeting to give a reminder, but make sure the announcement is in [Slack](team_chat.md), in email, and/or on the calendar.
1. Sharing goal-oriented progress updates is OK, but don't share task-oriented progress updates.
  - The interface between your team and other teams is your [goals](../../company/goals/index.md), not your tasks.
  - Focusing on tasks instead of goals overloads other people with irrelevant information. This makes them tune out and probably miss or forget the important information.
  - Example:
    - Good: "On GitLab support in campaigns, we fixed all 7 bugs reported by other team members and are shipping it to the first beta customers today."
	- Bad: "We fixed an issue where API rate limits for merge requests would ... and another issue where the status from the GitLab webhook payload ..."

## Agenda

1. Introduce any new team members starting this week
   - The manager of the team member presents a brief (~30-second) intro, stating the new team member's role, why we hired them, and what their first project is (if known). Then the person should pass it off to the new team member to say hello and share a fun fact about themselves. {#new-team-member-intro}
1. Work anniversaries (owner: @sqs presents)
1. Inspiration of the week (message @sqs to volunteer to present an inspiration)
1. Changelog from last week (owner: @christina)
1. Progress on our [company goals](../../company/goals/index.md) (owner: @sqs)
1. Product metrics update (owner: @ericbm)
1. All customer [bookings](../ops/finance/index.md#booking) and churn since the previous company meeting (owner: @tommy, @gregg presents)
1. New and expansion pipeline: include full table, discuss only significant changes since the previous company meeting (owner: @joe kirscher, @gregg presents)
1. Hiring: Open roles we're hiring for, offers extended/accepted/rejected (owner: @david)
1. What's new in the [handbook](../index.md) (owner: @dan)
1. Anything else that team members need to communicate
   - Just add a slide (awesome, useful, and quick) and write what you'll say in the speaker notes. Get @sqs's approval 72 hours before company meeting.
1. Q&A about anything Sourcegraph-related
   - [Submit a question anonymously](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiyIU67N_0m3xNBV-pONnVAGuBPsKQ_w-ZxtS-g8ZLWX--Ew/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## Recordings

> We haven't automated this process yet.

@sqs will post the company meeting recording in #general after the meeting finishes. If @sqs is not working on a given day or if he forgets, here is the process:

1. Go to https://zoom.us/recording/management (as a Zoom admin).
1. Next to the correct item (Topic: `Company meeting`), press `Share...`.
1. In the dialog, select `Share this recording: Publicly` and press `Save`.
1. Ensure `Password protection` is on.
1. Press `Copy sharing information to clipboard`.
1. Write a message in #general saying `Company meeting W21 slides + recording` (replace `W21` with the actual week number from the title of the Google Slides doc).
1. As a reply to that message's thread, paste the copied Zoom recording info and a link to the Google Slides doc.

## Presenters who can't attend

Mention people on the slide with something like the following:

> +whoever@sourcegraph.com: FYI this company meeting is on US Memorial Day, so I am assuming you will not be attending. Please write notes that someone can read, or record a video of yourself presenting, and send to me by Sunday 3pm PDT.
