# Company meeting

1. Schedule: every Monday 10:30-11:00am PST/PDT (link in the calendar event)
   - If Monday is a holiday, the meeting is held on the next non-holiday day.
   - There is no company meeting held between December 25 and December 31. The first company meeting of the year is held on the first non-holiday Monday of the year.
1. The link to the slides is posted in #general each Thursday before.
1. We used to call this "team meeting", but now we call it "company meeting" because "team meeting" sounds like it's only for one specific team inside the company.

## Why do we have company meeting?

Company meeting is an effective way to:

1. Bring the team together regularly so we feel connected despite being [located all around the world](../../company/remote/index.md).
1. Hold ourselves accountable to our goals.
1. Share achievements or learning across teams and functions.
1. Recognize individual team members for special contributions and on anniversaries.

## Effective communication

1. Before you create or present something at company meeting, think about what you are trying to communicate.
   - What important sentiment or information do you need to share with team members? Why?
   - If you don't know, then do not present.
1. Always give brief background on your project or function, even if it sounds obvious.
   - This helps spread consistent, effective ways to talk about our company and product.
     - Example: "On campaigns, we heard from Acme Corp that..." vs. "Campaigns let you make large-scale fixes across all of your code. Acme Corp told us that..."
	 - Example: "Marketing update: our new lead sources..." vs. "Marketing is about getting enterprise developers to know about and want to try Sourcegraph. Our new lead sources..."
   - Remember that other team members are new to the company and/or busy on their own projects.
1. Don't make announcements or share other specific information that you expect everyone to remember.
  - You can't assume everyone is attending company meeting and is paying attention.
  - Use company meeting to give a reminder, but make sure the announcement is in [Slack](team_chat.md), in email, and/or on the calendar.
1. Sharing goal-oriented progress updates is OK, but don't share task-oriented progress updates.
  - The interface between your team and other teams is your goals ([OKRs](../../company/okrs/index.md)), not your tasks.
  - Focusing on tasks instead of goals overloads other people with irrelevant information. This makes them tune out and probably miss or forget the important information.
  - Example:
    - Good: "On GitLab support in campaigns, we fixed all 7 bugs reported by other team members and are shipping it to the first beta customers today."
	- Bad: "We fixed an issue where API rate limits for merge requests would ... and another issue where the status from the GitLab webhook payload ..."

## Agenda

1. Introduce any new team members starting this week
   - The manager of the team member presents a brief (~30-second) intro, stating the new team member's role, why we hired them, and what their first project is  (if known). Then the manager should pass it off to the new team member to say hello and share a fun fact about themselves.
